**Keerthi Suresh** as the main character of the  OTT released film Penguin.This movie can be included in the genres **Drama**, **Mystery** and **Thriller** genres.
The film is about a pregnant mother trying to find her son, someone came in the face of Charlie Chaplin and kidnapped her son.
It must be said that searching for a serial killer on a regular page did not really work.
There are problems with the film since the average story is not casting enough. The story was made like a serial, with none other than Keerthi Suresh, who was familiar with the acting and the majority of the cast did not seem to have any acting experience.
All the characters speak like the sounds that can be heard when English movies are dubbed in Tamil. Acting is like serial.
The first half was really trying to be patient and the second half felt better. Not to mention the music of Santhosh Narayan but not too bad.Try to watch those who haven't seen.
