 **Frozen 2**  is an animated movie coming out at  **World Disney Productions**  in  **2019** . This is a must watch movie for anyone who loves animation. What makes this movie so good is its background score and each frame. The second part of the Frozen is better than the first part in all areas. "Frozen 2" takes Elsa and Anna two young princesses on a journey to save their country and discover the origins of Elsa's magical power. Christopher, Olaf, and Sven share a sense of humor in their adventure, and the movie gets a nice touch of comedy. For all anime movie lovers, I am suggesting to this film.
