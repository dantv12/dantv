It is a strange beginning because they are praying for India's loss. And the prayer gets gods attention and rain comes. In that rain heroin(Andrea) is trying to escape from rain and gone under a stone. There is also another person with big beard is there for the same reason. The rest is the movie.The director has dealt with a very sensitive subject. The Music director of the film is Yuvan Shankar Raja. The BGM and the songs were perfect for the film.
This is one of the last films of Lyrisist N. Muthukumar. Because the lyrics in this movie are strong.In the later movies of Yuvan without N.Muthukumar, it didn't felt like the past works of both.They were a good partners.
This movie is a watchable one.Therefore try to see!
