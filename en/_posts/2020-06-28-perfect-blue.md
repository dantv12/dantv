 **Perfect Blue**  is a Japanese anime psychological thriller movie directed by  **Satoshi Kon**  in 1997. The film goes through a singer called  **Meema** .
**Meema**  quits her singing career and chooses acting, and as a result she suffers a lot. This film is also about problems that she faced from changing her career from singer to actor. There is really cool stuff in this anime. Climax twist is no salvation. For those who havenâ€™t seen the anime yet, this would be a good start. Don't be avoided by the fact that it's a cartoon. The loss will be yours.
