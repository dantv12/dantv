After successfully overcoming the first two members of the Viper Squad, Beatrix sets her target on the remaining three. As she follows Bill's brother Bud, Elle Driver and ultimately Bill, she learns more about the story behind Beatrix. Trained in China under the legendary traditional martial arts legend Pei Mei, she learns a secret strategy that can kill any opponent who is interested in brutal activities. Meeting Bill will ultimately be a rewarding experience for Beatrix, but will she be able to get past Bud and Elle? 

The dialogue is more important than the action scenes and the lack of story is frustrating in the first half.
