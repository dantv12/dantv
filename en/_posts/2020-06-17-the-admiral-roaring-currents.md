Choi Min Sik, one of Korea's best actors, is one of the leading actors in the history war action drama movie.
The film is still at the top box office of all time at the Korean box office. You can understand the range of this movie right away.
The film is based on the decisions and actions of the hero, their admiral, who was trying to resist the invasion of Japan in 1597.
The hero who shows mass even with just a glance. The feel of each of Choi Min Sik's looks is beyond words.He was the best performer ever.The naval war scenes were pretty good. The film was a good experience when you had a good BGM.
The director has gotten a good grasp of just how much of a damage the war has done to them using just one female character.
Choi Min Sik, the hero in this movie also won the Asian Film Award for Best Actor. Definitely a must-see for those who haven't. This movie will never disappoint you.
