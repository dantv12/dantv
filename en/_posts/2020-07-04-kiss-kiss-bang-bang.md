Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a comedy mystery thriller movie starring **Robert Downey Jr.**, **Val Kilmer**, **Michelle Monaghan** in lead role. 
This movie is based on the novel ***Bᴏᴅɪᴇs Aʀᴇ Wʜᴇʀᴇ Yᴏᴜ Cᴀɴ Fɪɴᴅ Tʜᴇᴍ*** written by Brett Halliday. This movie is presented by blending comedy into a detective story. Still it was disgusting sometimes i kind of felt that this movie didn't use the mystery well. 
While watching the movie the full credit goes to RDJ and Val Kilmer, those who scored well in this movie, because of that the viewer doesn't have a chance to think what is coming next. When the big twist coming scene we have to watch it without any wonder. 
This movie is a watchable one as thinking of it as a comedy thriller movie, felt nothing more than that. Try to see those who haven't seen.
