The film stars **Chris Hermsworth**, **Rudraksh Jaiswal** and **Randeep Hooda** in the action crime thriller category.
The story takes place in India and Bangladesh. So they've tried to make casting from there as much as possible.
The main plus point of the film is the action itself. Such scenes were lame. An 11 minute long short fight scene is well executed.
The camera work was good. But the conversations seemed to be pretty boring. Delivery of dialogue at the place where sentiments seemed to be injected felt bad.
This movie never disappoints action movie fans. Try to see those who haven't seen.
