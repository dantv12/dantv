Celine Shamma is a renowned storyteller and director with films like Water Lilies and Tomboy. They were all romantic, poetic and artistic images at the same time. At the same time, the film is a visual illustration of a story inspired by the autobiography of a French writer named Annie Ernou. The film, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2019, won a Best Screenplay Award and later won multiple awards at various venues. The film was listed in the top 5 foreign language films of last year but was not considered an Oscar. Now let's get to the story.

The painter Marianne arrives on a remote island of 18th-century France, Britain, to paint a portrait of Helois, the daughter of the Duke. Helois must now marry the Italians in place of his sister, since his sister, who was engaged to the nobleman of Milanese Italy, recently died. But before Marianne arrived, Heloise had already ruined her mother's plan to send her portrait to Milan with a painter for evaluation of her upcoming husband. Now, Marianna must try to study Heloise by falsely pretending to be her acting companion, and then secretly drawing her. Is it possible to complete this creative work by forging a false image?

To put it simply, "A True Masterpiece". Undoubtedly, you have seen such an impressive and recent story. Every frame in this movie is as good and beautiful as a Ravi Varma film. The cinematography with the color palette is admirable. The fables, kept in memory of forbidden eternal love, are absolutely divine. Needless to say, Noemi Merlan and Adel Einel were living the characters with their own magnetic field. It is a spectacular show that can share a love without words even at a glance. The very coincidental Acapella song really helped to give a heavenly feel. So the picture presents a huge array of adjectives. You can definitely see this creative experience appealing to any type of audience.
