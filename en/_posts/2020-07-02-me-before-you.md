The film stars **Emilia Clark**, who was one of the strong characters in the world popular series Game Of Thrones. This movie can be included in the romance drama feel good category.
The film is based on the novel of the same name by Jojo Mayes. The film depicts the heroine who comes to need for a job and taking the job of caring a paralysed man(Sam Clafin)  and the movie follows the rest.
The story has been seen the same way before, but the quality of acting, BGM and music seemed to be the best experience.
After seeing her as a very powerful character in Game of Thrones, it was interesting to see Emilia Clark's innocent face expressions in this film.
This movie is a perfect choice for those who love romantic feel good movies.
