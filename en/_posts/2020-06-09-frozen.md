 **Frozen** directed by  **Jennifer Lee**  and  **Chris Buck**  and produced by  **Walt Disney** . We all have innate abilities or different qualities. People with such skills or variations are jumping at great risk. Thus, Elsa, the young prince of the kingdom of  **Marendel** , who is a child of supernatural powers, is in danger of losing her sister, Anna, because of her negligence in her youth. But when Elsa grew up, she realized that the supernatural power she was born with was still growing and that Elsa could no longer be a controller and that fear and panic would make Elsa demonic in the eyes of others. After covering Elsa's pathetic condition, her father, King  **Agnar** , and his mother,  queen  **Iduna** , travel to Elsa to find the source of this supernatural power. But in an accident, the ship crashes and they die, forcing Elsa to be crowned. On the other hand, Elsa is haunted by the reopening of the gate on the other side, wondering if the others will realize her supernatural powers at the coronation ceremony. 

Frozen is made up of a very entertaining presentation and visuals from beginning to end. Fans of animation movies must watch at least once. Frozen is the perfect back ground score for each piece so it can really feel good.
