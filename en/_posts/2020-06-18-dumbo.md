The film stars **Colin Farrel**, **Eva Green**, **Danny DeVito** and **Michael Keaton** in the family fantasy adventure genre.I thought of this movie as a child movie, but when watching I kind of felt like a dialogue in the movie "**You have made me child again**". 
The story begins with the baby Dumbo be born by the newly purchased elephant in a Circus set. The issues that come up later are presented in very interesting manner.Although it is not difficult to see, it is a minor drawback that the conflict in the story can be seen only in the last half hour.Still, a **good experience** film is guaranteed. Try to see those who haven't seen.
