'**Paatal Lok**' is a web series released via **Amazon Prime** in 2020. The series, which was produced by renowned Bollywood actress **Anushka Sharma**, has already garnered considerable controversy. The series has been controversial because of the fact that it is a raw version of events that are confined to only dialogues in other Indian movies and series. **The story unfolds through a crime scene in Delhi and an investigation by a police officer centered on it**. This investigation exposes corruption and inequalities that exist in our political, media, legal, and caste systems. The series has **9 thrilling episodes** and as the series progresses, we can feel the change in the first impression made by many characters. An example is the character of **Vishal Tyagi**. By the end of the series, we may wish to see that character because of the performance of the actor and the impact made by him in the story. This series has a flawless screenplay which is backed by an excellent performance by the actors. **Therefore, in my personal opinion, this series can be considered as one of the best Indian web series.**
