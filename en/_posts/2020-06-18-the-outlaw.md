**The Outlaw** is a South Korean crime action thriller movie released in 2017 with **Ma Dong-seok** as the hero.

This movie is based on **Heuksapa Incident**. **Yoon-Seong Kang** Even if this movie was made, it would be a moment to say that it was based on a Real Incident. The action scenes are very much good. The movie is a good entertainer with a good background score for the field.

I am sure this movie will entertain those who like Action & Crime movies.
