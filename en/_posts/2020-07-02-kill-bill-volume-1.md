**Beatrix Kido** is a trained female killer, betrayed by "**The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad**" led by former boss Bill, and finally attacked on the wedding day.

Four years later she begins her hunt for revenge. With the help of sword maker Hattori Hanzo, she sets out to eliminate the first two targets on her list: Vernita Green, who retired from the squad, and O-Ren, the queen of the Tokyo underworld. She has no rest without killing every member of the squad.

Tarantino Brilliance can be seen throughout the film. The best action movie of all time is still adored by audiences alike.
