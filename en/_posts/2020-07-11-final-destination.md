Starring **Devon Sawa**, **Ali Larter** and **Kerr Smith** in the lead roles, the film can be considered as horror thriller movie.
This is the first film in a 5 part film series.
Talking of horror,  it is not a ghost story with jump scares. Everyone's death has a design. If we can break that design, we can beat death. A hero's actions, whether knowingly or unconsciously, result in something else. It is worth noting that the film was taken with great detailing.
BGM and Camera Works all helped to make the film enjoyable.
It is not difficult to see the film with a little thrill without being boring. Try to see those who haven't seen.
