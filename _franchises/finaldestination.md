  Final Destination is an American horror franchise composed of five films, two
  comic books, and nine novels. It is based on an unproduced spec script by
  Jeffrey Reddick, originally written for The X-Files television series, and was
  distributed by New Line Cinema. All five films center around a small group of
  people who escape impending death when one individual (the protagonist of each
  film) has a sudden premonition and warns them that they will all die in a
  terrible mass-casualty accident.
