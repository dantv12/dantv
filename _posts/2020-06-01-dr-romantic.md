#### Season 1 :

As an emotionally charged, uplifting medical drama, “Dr. Romantic” probes into seemingly cliched values regarding what makes a meaningful life. The story centers around a once-famous surgeon at the top of his field who suddenly retired to a secluded, countryside hospital. Those who cross his path learn about the values of life and comforts of love.

#### Season 2 :

**Kim Sa Bu** once gained fame as a top surgeon at a huge hospital. One day, he left the industry, and now he is a chief surgeon at **Doldam Hospital** in the countryside. After he conducted a successful operation on Chairman Shin, he gets to improve the hospital under reliable support. But then Chairman Shin passes away. New people appear and his students had to leave the hospital. Furthermore, his wrist, which was injured three years ago, starts to act weird. After all, he goes to a huge hospital himself to solve the manpower shortage at Doldam Hospital, where he finds two people who resemble his former students but who seem much more lacking. **Seo Woo Jin** would do anything for money, and **Cha Eun Jae** runs out every time she goes into a surgery room. Will Kim Sa Bu be able to run Doldam Hospital with these two?
