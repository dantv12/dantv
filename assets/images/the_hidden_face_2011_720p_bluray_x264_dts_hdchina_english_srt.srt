00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:27,000
<i>Hello, Adri.</i>

3
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:31,542
<i>Um, this isn't easy.</i>

4
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,167
<i>I wasn't strong enough
to tell you face-to-face.</i>

5
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:39,833
<i>Maybe this is the way
to avoid useless arguments.</i>

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,792
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

7
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,167
<i>I love you so much...</i>

8
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:46,167
<i>...but I can't carry on with you.</i>

9
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,000
<i>Please don't look for me,
and don't hate me.</i>

10
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,042
THE HIDDEN FACE

11
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,500
Good evening.

12
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,250
What are you having?

13
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,000
Whiskey with one ice cube, please.

14
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,792
Right away.

15
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:11,125
I don't like seeing men cry.

16
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:14,500
When a man cries,
it's because he feels guilty.

17
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,875
Not always.

18
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:37,250
Excuse me. We're closing up.

19
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,542
Never mind.

20
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,875
Are you all right?

21
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,833
No, I'm not all right.

22
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,292
What's up, pal?

23
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,625
What are you doing?

24
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,125
Leave him, he's drunk. Let's go.

25
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,208
But he hit me! Didn't you see?

26
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,250
- Let's go. It's over.
- Sure, sure.

27
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,042
What happened?

28
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,000
Why did they hit you?

29
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,333
Nothing happened.

30
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,500
Careful.

31
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,708
Ooh. Ah.

32
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,375
Does it hurt?

33
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,000
No, it's nothing.

34
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,625
You can't go like this.

35
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:52,875
I'll call a taxi. Where do you live?

36
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,792
Where do I live?

37
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,708
- No.
- What are you doing? Ha, ha.

38
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,375
I'm conducting.

39
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:08,792
What's the tempo?

40
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,833
Don't turn it down, I'm conducting.

41
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:27,958
Forcefully.

42
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,375
Don't fall down.

43
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:34,542
One, two, almost there.

44
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,667
Three, four. Good.

45
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:47,500
- Careful.
- Where's a sofa?

46
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,167
Careful.

47
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,250
Good morning.

48
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,167
Where am I?

49
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,167
My Place.

50
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,667
I have to go.

51
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,167
Adrian, isn't it? I'm Fabiana.

52
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:23,000
- How do you know my name?
- You told me.

53
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,958
What happened last night?
Why were you fighting?

54
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,667
I really have to go.

55
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,500
Thank you.

56
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,167
That's all for today.

57
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:48,667
Whiskey with one ice cube.

58
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,458
I came to apologize.

59
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,167
I was a dick this morning.

60
00:07:58,292 --> 00:07:59,667
Yes, that's true.

61
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,792
I also wanted to thank you
for helping me.

62
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,042
You didn't have to.

63
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,542
- Anyone would've done it.
- No, I don't think so.

64
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,375
Excuse me.

65
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,500
Would you like to sit with me?

66
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,667
No, I can't, I have to work.

67
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,542
Sure. Then I suggest something.

68
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,833
What?

69
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,000
Wow, this is incredible.

70
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,333
The instruments are arranged
from lesser to greater volume.

71
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,375
First the strings:
violins, violas, cellos and basses.

72
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:46,667
Then woodwinds,
horns and percussion at the back.

73
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,875
And that's it.

74
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,833
It's a very special place.
Thanks for bringing me.

75
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,167
You're welcome.

76
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,833
- I like seeing you like this.
- Like what?

77
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:01,500
Relaxed, happy, okay.

78
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,500
I bet you're married
or have a girlfriend.

79
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,750
Neither.

80
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,958
I like this mirror.

81
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,625
Fabiana.

82
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,208
Hello.

83
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,667
- Have you been up long?
- No.

84
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,542
Want some breakfast?

85
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,667
Let's go.

86
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,167
This place is huge.

87
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,500
Why don't you live in the city?

88
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's quieter. I concentrate better.

89
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,333
Nature is inspiring.

90
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:55,042
Yes, but not just the beautiful side.

91
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,250
I like what's behind too,
hidden, you know?

92
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:01,875
Hmm.

93
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:07,292
- When do you go to work?
- I'm not working today.

94
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,250
No? I am.

95
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,667
Sleep here tonight.

96
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,125
I'll pick you up later.

97
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:20,167
All right.

98
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:21,958
Okay.

99
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,333
Morning, maestro.
- Morning.

100
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,958
Maestro.

101
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:37,625
I assume there's no news
of Miss Belen Echeverria.

102
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:41,167
- I don't know anything.
- Have you got company?

103
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,875
Are we interrupting?

104
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:48,958
Come in.

105
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,833
BUITRAGO If I may.

106
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,125
Nice to meet you, miss.

107
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,250
Francisco Jose Buitrago, DA's office.

108
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,000
Fabiana Caicedo.

109
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,833
- Bernardo Ramirez, my partner.
- How are you?

110
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,125
Your girlfriend hasn't left the country.

111
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:10,708
I confirmed it with Immigration.

112
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,875
- We want to look at the house.
- Is that necessary?

113
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,667
Absolutely, maestro. You never know.

114
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:23,792
- What was your name?
- Fabiana Caicedo.

115
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:28,667
Fabiana. If I may.

116
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,333
Ah.

117
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,458
Beautiful.

118
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,292
Very nice. Very nice.

119
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,500
Congratulations, a very pretty house.

120
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,125
- Thanks a lot.
- Yours, isn't it?

121
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:55,667
Rented.

122
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:58,292
How long have you lived here?

123
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,167
Almost two months.

124
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,792
Did Miss Echeverria leave anything?

125
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:08,833
A few things in the bathroom.
Creams, a toothbrush.

126
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,833
And work items. That's her workshop.

127
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,667
What's going on?

128
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:32,792
She didn't disappear.
She left me for another man.

129
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,708
- The police are investigating.
- It's routine.

130
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,958
They don't know anything.

131
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,667
Her friends or family in Spain?

132
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:45,333
I tried every means to contact her.
They never replied.

133
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,000
Nor do I want to alarm anyone.

134
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,125
Aren't you worried?

135
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,167
Of course, but I know she's all right.

136
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,292
You don't think she's dead?

137
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:58,792
No.

138
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,292
- What if she was kidnapped?
- Please.

139
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:08,000
Do they think I've got her buried
in the garden?

140
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,333
What are you doing?

141
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:54,292
Come up, it's late.

142
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,833
- I'll be right there.
- I'll be waiting.

143
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:04,500
- Fabiana.
- Adrian, don't scare me.

144
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,458
What's wrong?

145
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,875
I don't like the lights going out
in this place.

146
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,833
They do when it rains. It's fine.

147
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,625
Are you all right?

148
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,833
Come here.

149
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:22,500
See? It comes back on its own.
Ha, ha. Don't be scared.

150
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,000
You're so clean.

151
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,333
You left me waiting.

152
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,542
The water was lovely.

153
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,750
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

154
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,125
Can you get the dog out, please?

155
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,500
Hans, out.

156
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,625
Fabiana, don't you think
it's a bit rushed...

157
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:11,125
...this guy going out with you
just after his girl vanished?

158
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:12,667
No, I don't.

159
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I wouldn't be so calm if I were you.

160
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,167
- Why?
- He's a suspect.

161
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:25,125
That doesn't mean he is guilty.

162
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:26,958
Besides, she left him.

163
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,500
We don't know that for sure.

164
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,458
Are you jealous?

165
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:40,208
You finally got what you wanted,
a guy with money.

166
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,458
Better than a cop with a shit salary.

167
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,458
You may be right.

168
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,542
Tito.

169
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,833
The orchestra manager. Remember?

170
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,958
I'd like you to meet Fabiana.

171
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,833
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Oh, I saw you.

172
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:35,208
I was right behind you in the concert.
Roberto Peña.

173
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,042
Fabiana Caicedo. Nice to meet you.

174
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,375
Tito makes sure all this
comes off perfectly.

175
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,042
He's a wonderful boss.

176
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,500
On the contrary, Adrian,
you know we were lucky...

177
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,792
...and privileged to have you.

178
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,958
The orchestra and I won't forget you.

179
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:54,125
I'll miss you when I go, which is soon.

180
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:57,750
That's life.

181
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,167
Hans.

182
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:20,500
Out. Get out of here.

183
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,792
Who's there?

184
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:06,833
Adrian?

185
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,667
Who is it?

186
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:26,625
Who is it?

187
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:41,458
Does it still hurt? Here.

188
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:45,250
In half an hour it won't hurt any more.

189
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:52,167
All right?

190
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:57,875
I don't want to be alone in this house.
What if something bad happened to me?

191
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,875
Nothing happened.

192
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:04,667
The lights went because of the rain,
and the dog scared you, that's all.

193
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,875
No? What happened?

194
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,375
I think there's a ghost.

195
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,792
- Ha, ha. Fabiana...
- Don't laugh, I'm serious.

196
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:22,833
What ghost? Where is it?

197
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,167
It's here. Listen.

198
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,000
Right...

199
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:36,500
- Hear it?
- There is a weird sound.

200
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,292
See?

201
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:42,792
It could be the wind
through the plumbing.

202
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,958
No?

203
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,167
Hmm.

204
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,708
Ghost down there...

205
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:55,542
...if you bother Fabiana,
you'll be dealing with me, all right?

206
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,708
I think that'll do it.

207
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,167
No, something's going on here.

208
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,958
Don't worry.

209
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:09,250
Let's go to sleep.
I'll put ice on your head.

210
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,292
Thanks.

211
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,958
Yes.

212
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:22,333
Yes, that's me.

213
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:24,375
What?

214
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:35,500
Yes, I'll be there in half an hour.

215
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:40,000
What's wrong?

216
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,833
What happened?

217
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,500
It was the DA's office.

218
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:52,875
They say they've found a body
that could be Belen.

219
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,667
They want me to identify the body.

220
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:21,667
We have the body here of a young lady
with similar characteristics...

221
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:25,167
...to Miss Belen Echeverria,
and we want you to help us identify her.

222
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:27,000
- Very well.
- Follow me.

223
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,542
Mr. Salamanca.
- Hello.

224
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:46,000
Her face is unrecognizable
due to the fire.

225
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,750
It was impossible to identify her.

226
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,292
It's not Belen.

227
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:02,667
- Are you sure, maestro?
- Completely.

228
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:35,542
FABIANA I'm sorry.

229
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,625
- Hi.
- Who were you talking to?

230
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:47,500
- What happened out there?
- To nobody. I was looking for a book.

231
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,792
How did it go?

232
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,833
- Was it her?
- No.

233
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:00,000
Belen is no longer in my life.

234
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:01,625
All right?

235
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,000
I love you.

236
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:34,125
Are you following me or not?

237
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:14,958
Why this great honor, you cooking?

238
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:18,208
- I cook a lot.
- Yeah.

239
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:19,958
I have to tell you something.

240
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:23,167
Good or bad?

241
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,167
Well...

242
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:30,000
Remember I was a candidate
to conduct the Bogota Philharmonic?

243
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:34,625
- Yes.
- They called me today...

244
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:38,292
...and they've chosen me.

245
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,167
Really?

246
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:45,708
- Adri, really?
- Ha, ha. Yes.

247
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:49,000
Congratulations, honey.

248
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:51,333
That's great.

249
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,667
I'm so happy, I really am.

250
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,542
I leave in 15 days.

251
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,250
In 15 days?

252
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,792
- For how long?
- A year.

253
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,167
A year?

254
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,833
Well, then...

255
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,792
- I don't know.
- You are coming with me?

256
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,667
What, to Bogotá?

257
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:28,333
You want me to go to Bogotá
for a year with you in 15 days?

258
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:34,833
What do I do about my job,
for example?

259
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,125
Come and then we'll see.

260
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:04,625
Okay.

261
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:08,791
If I come with you,
do you promise to take care of me?

262
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,166
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

263
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,750
What?

264
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:25,125
You won't leave me alone?

265
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:27,458
You'll be with me?

266
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:32,250
Mm, I won't leave you alone
for one second.

267
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,458
Adrian was wonderful.

268
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:23,000
There are very few conductors
of his age with such talent.

269
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,875
I wasn't wrong to get him.

270
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:28,000
No, you have a good eye.

271
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:31,500
- So do you.
- Well, I'll get him.

272
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:34,791
- Well done, Tito.
- Congratulations to you too.

273
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,041
Thanks.

274
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,500
Yes.

275
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:40,791
- Hi.
- Hi, Belen.

276
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,333
How are you? I was looking for you.

277
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,791
I was saying goodbye to Veronica.
Remember her?

278
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,666
- Sure. How are you?
- How are you?

279
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:48,875
Great.

280
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:51,833
- Did you like the concert?
- Very much. You were all great.

281
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,833
Let's go.
- Yes.

282
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,541
- Bye.
- Bye.

283
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:01,500
I didn't know
you were such a good conductor, sir.

284
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:04,125
Excuse me, miss,
are you trying to pick me up?

285
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:07,208
I won't deny it. I am a little.

286
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:11,000
- And are you picking me up?
- Who else?

287
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:14,500
- I don't know.
- "I don't know"?

288
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,666
- Eh?
- I'm just kidding, silly. Ha, ha.

289
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,833
I know you only have eyes for me.

290
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:34,958
This house was built
by a very interesting Italian architect...

291
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,125
...a very famous one.

292
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:40,375
- Oh, please.
- Ha, ha. This is my dog, Hans.

293
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:43,291
He's a good dog, aren't you, Hans?

294
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:47,666
Hello, Hans. You're gorgeous.

295
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:50,333
It seems he likes you.

296
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,333
I love dogs.

297
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,166
Then some modifications were done.

298
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:01,041
I took care of the garden.
Botany is my passion.

299
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,000
- Is your husband German too?
- He was.

300
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:11,125
He came to Colombia to work,
and I followed him, in love.

301
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:13,458
A toast to that.

302
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:18,333
Mm. You have a piano.

303
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,833
It's not just any piano,
it's a very fine German piano.

304
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,458
- May I?
- Sure.

305
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:31,125
- Do you play?
- No, not a note.

306
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:34,333
But my boyfriend does.
He conducts the philharmonic.

307
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,333
Oh, yes? How marvelous.

308
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:39,541
- Like you, I followed him to Colombia.
- Ah.

309
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:42,375
That's love.

310
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,541
For some time, I've been living
in a small flat in the city.

311
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,125
I only spend weekends here.

312
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:55,375
Here we have the bathroom.

313
00:36:55,541 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm going back to Berlin in a month.
I've got mixed feelings about it.

314
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:04,000
If you like the house,
you can have it when you like.

315
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,666
- There's only one drawback.
- What's that?

316
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:10,958
The person who stays
has to look after my dog, Hans.

317
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:14,791
No, no problem. As I said, I love dogs.

318
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:16,250
Fabulous.

319
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,833
Adrian.

320
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,500
What's the purpose of the table here?

321
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,000
- I don't quite understand.
- It's a great position.

322
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,750
Hans, get off.

323
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:34,791
So looking at the leather first...

324
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:39,000
...I like this one best,
for the texture and color.

325
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:42,333
It'd mean making one
with a rubber wedge like this...

326
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,625
...and another with a wooden heel.

327
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,541
Excuse me a second.

328
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,208
Hi, Emma. Good.

329
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:53,750
Yes, he's with me,
and he's behaving really well.

330
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:59,000
Oh, perfect.
Hans will be so happy to see you.

331
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:01,958
Okay, see you tomorrow, then.

332
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:04,458
- Who's this beastie?
- That's Hans.

333
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,958
Is it a problem letting him loose here?

334
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:11,375
No, we love dogs here,
and dogs love music.

335
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,625
Hello, Belen.

336
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:25,125
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Are you still rehearsing?

337
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:29,500
- No, I was talking to Veronica.
- Hello, Belen.

338
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:33,958
All right, then.

339
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:38,291
Finish your whiskey, rehearse...
I'll see you in the car.

340
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,125
I'll go too.

341
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:49,791
Miss Veronica, you appear to have
forgotten your violin.

342
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,875
Maestro.

343
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:00,833
- We weren't doing anything.
- And I'm not saying anything.

344
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,291
Aren't you going to talk
for the whole trip?

345
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,791
Belen?

346
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:21,333
Do you take all your musicians into
your office, or just the girl violinists?

347
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:23,791
Can't I speak to the musicians?

348
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:27,041
Sure, but talking and flirting
aren't the same thing.

349
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,125
- You're exaggerating.
- I'm exaggerating?

350
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,625
Yes.

351
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,166
I've seen you with her before.

352
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:35,458
- When?
- Forget it.

353
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:38,208
Do what you like.
It's your problem if you screw up.

354
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:41,750
Don't get a shock if one day you wake up
and I'm not there.

355
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,500
I'm sorry.

356
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,166
- How are the new designs?
- Fine.

357
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,125
Have you sent the sketches to Spain?

358
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:30,166
Yes, last week. They're very pleased.

359
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,791
Is the leather here all right?

360
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:36,291
- Fine, good quality.
- That's great.

361
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,000
I'm going.

362
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,000
Adrian?

363
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:45,125
What is it?

364
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:51,666
What have you got going
with that violinist Veronica?

365
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:56,291
Jeez, Belen.

366
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:58,833
I've got nothing going on with her.

367
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,958
Then why do you call
and text each other?

368
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,666
You looked at my phone?

369
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:10,333
Answer me.

370
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,833
I flirted with her a little, that's all.

371
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,875
Nothing happened.

372
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:21,000
I couldn't do anything to hurt you.

373
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,500
Then why flirt with her?

374
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,958
- We all flirt.
- No...

375
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:29,000
...we don't all flirt.

376
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:34,000
I love you and I'm with you.

377
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,500
There is nothing else.

378
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:43,250
What can I do for you to believe me?
Fire Veronica?

379
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:46,791
All right, fire her.

380
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:51,500
- I can't do that.
- Okay.

381
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:54,500
Get going. You'll be late.

382
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:02,000
It's fine.
I just need to be alone, that's all.

383
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:23,291
I left behind my life in Spain
to come here with him...

384
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:27,458
...and I don't know
if it was the right decision.

385
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,666
My husband was very involved
with his work.

386
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:34,500
It always came first.

387
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:37,041
But he couldn't live without me.

388
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,875
What did your husband do?

389
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:44,333
He was an engineer.

390
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:48,666
He had a prodigious mind.
He wooed me with it.

391
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:50,000
Can you believe it?

392
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,291
Sometimes I wonder...

393
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,875
...what would happen
if something happened to me...

394
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:02,791
...if I died or something.

395
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:04,666
How would Adrian react?

396
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:10,041
Why don't you test him?

397
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,500
What do you mean, "test"?

398
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:14,791
Yes, teach him a little lesson.

399
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:17,291
Love has to be absolute, doesn't it?

400
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:22,333
Can you keep a secret?

401
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:25,833
Come with me.

402
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:06,333
My husband felt
they could come for him...

403
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,166
...at any time,
like others in South America.

404
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:15,125
So he built this place.
He was obsessed with it.

405
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:19,708
He said it was a place
where one could die in peace.

406
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:21,333
And so he did.

407
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,833
Go in.

408
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:45,625
Reinforced glass, one-way vision.

409
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:49,958
Utterly soundproof.
It's hermetically sealed.

410
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:54,208
This is a dynamo to turn on the light.

411
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:55,958
Look.

412
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:58,000
See?

413
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:03,041
With this speaker,
you can hear everything outside.

414
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:07,291
This is crazy.

415
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:11,333
And here?

416
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:28,000
It's strange.

417
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:30,833
I haven't come in here for a long time.

418
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,458
Thank you
for showing me your secret.

419
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,666
It's ours now.

420
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:40,500
- Goodbye.
- All the best. Take care.

421
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:43,541
- I'll call you when I get to Berlin.
- Okay.

422
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:46,125
- All the best.
- Thanks.

423
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:48,666
Have a nice trip.

424
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:51,208
And thanks for everything, Emma.

425
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:54,458
You're welcome. Take care, eh?

426
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:37,500
Hello, Adrian. I'm leaving
because I've met someone...

427
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:43,000
...at the gym, and he gets me hot.

428
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,625
Hello, Adrian.

429
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:51,666
Look, I'm off to Spain,
and you know why?

430
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:53,666
Because I'm fucking fed up.

431
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:56,166
<i>Hello, Adri.</i>

432
00:48:57,333 --> 00:49:00,750
Um, this isn't easy.

433
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,500
I wasn't strong enough
to tell you face-to-face.

434
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:08,750
Maybe this is the way
to avoid useless arguments.

435
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,958
I'm leaving.

436
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:14,333
I love you so much...

437
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:16,958
...but I can't carry on with you.

438
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:21,041
I think this is the best for both of us.

439
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,791
Please don't look for me,
and don't hate me.

440
00:50:56,666 --> 00:50:58,666
VIDEO
FOR ADRIAN

441
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:08,291
<i>Hello, Adri.</i>

442
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:11,875
<i>Um, this isn't easy.</i>

443
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:15,458
<i>I wasn't strong enough
to tell you face-to-face.</i>

444
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:04,625
Belen, I just saw the video.

445
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,666
I don't get it.

446
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,833
I don't know what's going on.

447
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,333
Call me when you can, okay?

448
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:33,500
Adrian! Adri, I'm here! I'm here! Adri!

449
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:40,166
Adrian! Adrian!

450
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:43,375
No, don't go, Adri!

451
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,500
Holy shit.

452
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:04,125
Come on.

453
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:08,541
Fuck!

454
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,833
Adrian! Adrian!

455
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:30,166
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Adri.

456
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:35,333
I'm so sorry.

457
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:53,833
I love you.

458
00:55:58,125 --> 00:55:59,791
Adri.

459
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:04,833
Help me.

460
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:12,750
<i>...but I can't carry on with you.</i>

461
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:15,958
<i>I think this is the best for both of us.</i>

462
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,458
<i>Please don't look for me,
and don't hate me.</i>

463
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:24,500
- Do you suspect anyone?
- What do you mean, "suspect anyone"?

464
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:26,041
She's a beautiful woman.

465
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,500
Suddenly there's an admirer,
a friend, a lover.

466
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:31,500
No. We hardly know anyone here.

467
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:33,958
She was alone a lot, but I doubt it.

468
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:37,541
This was the 8th of August,
the last day you saw her.

469
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:38,791
- Yes.
Mm-hm.

470
00:56:40,291 --> 00:56:41,291
Mr. Peña?

471
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:44,333
I saw her the day before.
She came here.

472
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:47,333
Did she say anything
that could help us?

473
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:51,000
Why don't you tell them, Adrian?

474
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:57,708
- We argued. Nothing important.
- Everything's important here.

475
00:56:57,875 --> 00:57:00,791
A couple's spat, that's all.

476
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:04,000
What happened was that
Belen surprised Adrian...

477
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:06,291
...with a member of the orchestra.

478
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:09,666
Nothing happened,
they were having a drink...

479
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:11,958
...but Belen was annoyed.

480
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:15,708
It's not important, it isn't. What's
important is finding out where she is.

481
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:19,166
- That's what we have to find out.
- We have to wait now.

482
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:20,500
Maybe she'll turn up.

483
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:24,750
Maestro, we have no traces
of a kidnapping or forced disappearance.

484
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:29,000
We'll go to Immigration
and see if she left the country.

485
00:57:29,125 --> 00:57:32,291
We'll check your house
to see if something can help us find her.

486
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:36,958
So you don't think anything bad
happened to her?

487
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:40,208
These cases
are more common than you might think.

488
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:41,958
Even in this country.

489
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:53,750
- All the best.
- What?

490
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,458
Adri.

491
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:00,458
Adri.

492
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:02,958
What do you mean, "all the best"?

493
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,666
Adri.

494
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:09,458
What does "all the best" mean?
Adrian.

495
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:13,375
You can't say that!
It couldn't be worse!

496
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:40,000
Adrian!

497
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:43,375
Adrian, look at the ripples!

498
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:49,833
Adri, look at them!

499
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:55,333
Adri, no. Adrian!

500
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:57,833
Adri!

501
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,125
Fucking hell.

502
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:57,000
What's wrong with this?

503
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:07,333
Come on.

504
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,166
Don't do this to me, please.

505
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:52,666
I like this mirror.

506
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:03,666
No, please, no.

507
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:09,333
Adri, please don't do this.

508
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:56,000
Stop it, please, stop.

509
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:03,500
Stop!

510
01:04:04,791 --> 01:04:06,666
Stop!

511
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:09,958
Stop it! Shut up!

512
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:45,625
Where the hell did you come from?

513
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:03,500
That's my toothbrush.

514
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:06,333
Fucking bitch.

515
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:09,958
Fucking bitch.

516
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:16,791
Help!

517
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:27,500
Help! Here! Help!

518
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:33,666
Help! Here! Help!

519
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,500
Oh, I scalded you.

520
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:48,625
What a bummer, eh?
Sorry, but I've got to do it.

521
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:50,666
You understand, don't you, Fabiana?

522
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:53,166
Fabiana!

523
01:07:59,666 --> 01:08:02,500
Fabiana, can you hear me?

524
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:11,375
Hans.

525
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:16,250
Out. Get out of here.

526
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:18,750
Fuck.

527
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,625
Having a great time, huh?

528
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,833
How old are you? Five?

529
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:02,250
What are you doing?

530
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:14,291
The key. Fabiana.

531
01:09:14,458 --> 01:09:17,166
You've found the key, Fabiana.

532
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:21,333
Okay, now think. Fabiana, listen to me.

533
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:27,291
Very good, Fabiana. Listen to me.
Listen to me. Think.

534
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,666
What are you doing?

535
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:35,000
Don't do that! It's not a necklace!
Listen to me!

536
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:39,541
Why do the lights cut out
in this shitty house?

537
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:43,125
Fabiana, no. The key, Fabiana!

538
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:20,958
Will you pass me that?

539
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,708
Thanks.

540
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,666
Yes. Yes, that's me.

541
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:29,375
What?

542
01:10:32,791 --> 01:10:34,666
What's wrong?

543
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:38,541
They say they've found a body
that could be Belen.

544
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:57,000
Don't smile, bitch, I'm not dead.

545
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:13,958
Well, you're not as thick as I thought.

546
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:22,166
Start.

547
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:30,458
Stop.

548
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:36,500
Good, Fabiana. No.

549
01:12:40,458 --> 01:12:42,666
Don't stop now. Fabiana, come back.

550
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,625
That's it, come on.

551
01:12:49,041 --> 01:12:50,750
Come on, come on, come on.

552
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:53,000
Start.

553
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:58,333
Stop.

554
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:00,791
Is anyone there?

555
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:02,666
Yes!

556
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,166
Are you talking to me?

557
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:13,250
- Good, Fabiana.
- Adrian, is it you?

558
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:17,541
Don't play with me.

559
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,791
Come on. Come on.

560
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:31,166
- Papa?
- No.

561
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:33,166
Christ, Fabiana, think.

562
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,000
- Belen?
- Yes!

563
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:50,333
Come on, Fabiana.

564
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:54,958
- Are you dead?
- You wish. Come on.

565
01:13:57,125 --> 01:13:58,333
Are you alive?

566
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:04,125
Are you trapped?

567
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:06,291
Yes!

568
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:13,500
Did Adrian lock you up?

569
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:16,166
No. Come on, Fabiana, keep asking.

570
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:18,291
Keep going.

571
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,875
Behind the mirror?

572
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,333
Yes!

573
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:37,166
Good, Fabiana, good.

574
01:14:41,666 --> 01:14:43,291
No.

575
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:58,250
The other mirror is the door?

576
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,541
Yes!

577
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:07,250
Good, Fabiana.

578
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,500
Come on.

579
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:20,333
The ward robe, Fabiana.

580
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:29,375
The wardrobe.
How the hell do I tell you?

581
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:36,833
The wardrobe, the wardrobe.

582
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:46,125
Very good, Fabiana.

583
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,166
Yes.

584
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:49,833
Fabiana, what are you doing?

585
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:57,041
Fabiana!

586
01:16:58,791 --> 01:17:00,958
Why won't you open up?

587
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:12,250
What the fuck are you doing?
Open up!

588
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:16,666
I'm sorry.

589
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:36,500
- Hi.
- Who were you talking to?

590
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:40,250
- What happened out there?
- To nobody. I was looking for a book.

591
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:46,125
How did it go? Was it her?

592
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:47,875
- Fucking bitch.
- No.

593
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,291
Fucking bitch.

594
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:57,666
Fabiana, you fucking bitch! Open up!

595
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:07,541
Fabiana, you fucking bitch...

596
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,458
...you can't leave me here.

597
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:12,166
Fabiana, open up!

598
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:15,375
You can't leave me here!

599
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:18,000
Open up! Open up!

600
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:35,541
Adrian.

601
01:18:37,666 --> 01:18:39,000
What are you doing?

602
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:41,541
I couldn't sleep.

603
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:44,458
Are you all right?

604
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:47,333
Go to bed. I'll be right there.

605
01:18:49,666 --> 01:18:50,791
Relax, Hans.

606
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,333
Relax, it's all right.

607
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:05,250
It's all right, relax.

608
01:19:47,958 --> 01:19:49,958
Maestro Salamanca.

609
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:53,166
- Ramirez.
- Everything all right?

610
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:54,625
Fine.

611
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:57,458
It's my duty to inform you
that as a judicial officer...

612
01:19:57,625 --> 01:20:00,458
...Miss Belen Echeverria
is now my case.

613
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:03,291
Officer Buitrago called me this morning
to tell me.

614
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:05,625
I hope you find her soon.

615
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:09,500
- We'll do all we can.
- Thanks a lot.

616
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,166
Do you want something?

617
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:34,125
Listen, maestro,
be very careful what you do.

618
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:36,166
What's wrong with you?

619
01:20:36,333 --> 01:20:39,000
I don't really care much
about your girlfriend.

620
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:43,666
But if something happens to Fabiana,
I'll kill you.

621
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:51,625
- Everything all right?
- Yes, thanks.

622
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,875
- Hi.
- Hi.

623
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:10,500
- Can I have one?
- You don't smoke.

624
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:24,541
What about the Spaniard?

625
01:21:25,375 --> 01:21:28,833
- What about him?
- How's it going with him?

626
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,625
Fine.

627
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:34,333
So are you going to Spain with him?

628
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:39,208
- We'll see what happens.
- And the girlfriend?

629
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:41,041
I don't know.

630
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,750
It's better she doesn't turn up, eh?

631
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:05,041
Belen.

632
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:14,500
Belen, are you all right?

633
01:22:53,791 --> 01:22:56,333
ARE YOU
OKAY?

634
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:11,958
What happened?

635
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:13,166
Hello.

636
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:15,833
Why did you change
everything around?

637
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:19,333
I wanted to surprise you.
This bathroom works properly.

638
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,166
- Oh, yes?
- Yes.

639
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:25,625
And the view from here is nicer.

640
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:29,500
Do you mind?

641
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:32,958
No, but I wish you'd asked me first.

642
01:23:34,125 --> 01:23:36,791
I thought you'd like it.

643
01:23:37,875 --> 01:23:39,166
It's fine.

644
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:07,833
- Adrian's not here.
- No? And where is he?

645
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,250
Working.

646
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:12,791
That's what you think.

647
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:22,958
Take care of yourself, Fabiana.

648
01:25:08,666 --> 01:25:10,375
Veronica.

649
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:15,500
Hello.

650
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:18,666
Let's see.

651
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:20,291
I like you a lot.

652
01:25:20,458 --> 01:25:22,958
I love hanging out with you,
but what we're doing...

653
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,791
I can't go on.

654
01:25:27,291 --> 01:25:28,833
Okay.

655
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:44,708
People, we'll begin on C.

656
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:49,041
Wind instruments, you are the melody.
Stand out, all right?
