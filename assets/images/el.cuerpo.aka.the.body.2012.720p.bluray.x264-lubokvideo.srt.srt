<font color="#ffff80">THE BODY</font>

3
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:41,751
<font color="#ffff80">Yes?</font>

4
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:46,709
<font color="#ffff80">I'll be right there.</font>

5
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:50,626
<font color="#ffff80">No, I'll take my car.</font>

6
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,293
<font color="#ffff80">I landed 3 hours ago.
I don't mind driving.</font>

7
00:02:57,084 --> 00:02:59,626
<font color="#ffff80">Then we'll go in yours.</font>

8
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:02,918
<font color="#ffff80">Sure, don't be a bore. Just hang up.
See you soon.</font>

9
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:20,668
<font color="#ffff80">It wasn't my idea to call you.
Technically you're on duty...</font>

10
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:21,751
<font color="#ffff80">What happened?</font>

11
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:23,543
<font color="#ffff80">We're still not sure.</font>

12
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:26,876
<font color="#ffff80">- How was Berlin?
- Fine. What have we got?</font>

13
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:29,543
<font color="#ffff80">A guy got run over,
he's in a coma.</font>

14
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,209
<font color="#ffff80">How's Eva?</font>

15
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:33,168
<font color="#ffff80">She's in Berlin. Tell
me what you know.</font>

16
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:35,376
<font color="#ffff80">You haven't seen your
daughter in 4 years...</font>

17
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:36,418
<font color="#ffff80">2 and a half.</font>

18
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,376
<font color="#ffff80">...And you go to
Berlin and fuck it up?</font>

19
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:41,334
<font color="#ffff80">- I didn't fuck it up, it was fine.
- Then why the long face?</font>

20
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:45,251
<font color="#ffff80">Will you stop busting my balls and
tell me what we're doing here?</font>

21
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:52,418
<font color="#ffff80">His name's Angel Torres. Skull
injury and cervical fractures.</font>

22
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:56,084
<font color="#ffff80">The doctors have stabilized him but
don't know when he'll come to.</font>

23
00:03:56,418 --> 00:03:59,293
<font color="#ffff80">The driver says he
was on the road,</font>

24
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,251
<font color="#ffff80">he couldn't swerve to miss him.</font>

25
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:03,209
<font color="#ffff80">- Blood alcohol?
- Negative.</font>

26
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,251
<font color="#ffff80">We only have his tracks in the woods.
He was running away.</font>

27
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:10,251
<font color="#ffff80">From what? Why was he running
in the woods at night?</font>

28
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:12,543
<font color="#ffff80">He works at the
Forensics Institute.</font>

29
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,084
<font color="#ffff80">The morgue?</font>

30
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,834
<font color="#ffff80">He's the night guard.</font>

31
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,668
<font color="#ffff80">Torres fled his
post around 8:30.</font>

32
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:57,584
<font color="#ffff80">He left via the security fence
and ran through the woods.</font>

33
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:00,126
<font color="#ffff80">The morgue people told us
that some guards panic</font>

34
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:02,751
<font color="#ffff80">when the alarms go off in
the refrigerated rooms.</font>

35
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,043
<font color="#ffff80">But that's not the case.</font>

36
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:08,209
<font color="#ffff80">No. Torres has been here for 3
years and no alarm went off.</font>

37
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,293
<font color="#ffff80">All we have is a phone call.</font>

38
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:13,584
<font color="#ffff80">He called us minutes
before he was run over.</font>

39
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:16,918
<font color="#ffff80">He wanted a patrol car to come.
He was jumpy and didn't say why.</font>

40
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,376
<font color="#ffff80">They put him through to
Carlos, who was on duty,</font>

41
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:22,959
<font color="#ffff80">but he'd already gone. They
called again, but no reply.</font>

42
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:25,293
<font color="#ffff80">- Why?
- We don't know.</font>

43
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,959
<font color="#ffff80">Was anyone else in the building?</font>

44
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:31,626
<font color="#ffff80">The doors to the morgue shut at 8.
Torres is the only night staff.</font>

45
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,084
<font color="#ffff80">So we have no fucking
idea what happened.</font>

46
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,293
<font color="#ffff80">The only reason the guard may
have panicked and run off</font>

47
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:40,168
<font color="#ffff80">is some kind of sick joke.</font>

48
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:43,668
<font color="#ffff80">According to the register,
a body is missing.</font>

49
00:05:53,626 --> 00:05:56,918
<font color="#ffff80">The missing body is a
woman, Mayka Villaverde.</font>

50
00:05:57,084 --> 00:06:01,084
<font color="#ffff80">Cause of death: heart attack.
Autopsy pending.</font>

51
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:03,168
<font color="#ffff80">Who signed the
death certificate?</font>

52
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:07,084
<font color="#ffff80">Dr. Tapia. No other forensic
had contact with the body.</font>

53
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,168
<font color="#ffff80">We've already informed her.</font>

54
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:33,043
<font color="#ffff80">The circuit's been disconnected.</font>

55
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,543
<font color="#ffff80">All the cameras are
out except one.</font>

56
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:37,793
<font color="#ffff80">I've paused the recording.</font>

57
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:44,876
<font color="#ffff80">Something's grabbed his attention.
No alarm went off,</font>

58
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:48,209
<font color="#ffff80">so we think this is when the
security cameras went out.</font>

59
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:51,418
<font color="#ffff80">He left his post for 5 minutes.</font>

60
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:54,001
<font color="#ffff80">When he came back,
this is what happened.</font>

61
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,209
<font color="#ffff80">All the cameras are
out except one.</font>

62
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:10,959
<font color="#ffff80">Why?</font>

63
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:16,293
<font color="#ffff80">Whoever did this is inept
or is playing with us.</font>

64
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,918
<font color="#ffff80">You think he's still here?</font>

65
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:21,876
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know, but I want
the building surrounded.</font>

66
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,709
<font color="#ffff80">The woods too.</font>

67
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:26,668
<font color="#ffff80">Take care of it. Okay, Norma?</font>

68
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:32,251
<font color="#ffff80">Something happened to make
the guard to run away,</font>

69
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,084
<font color="#ffff80">and unless we believe
the dead can walk,</font>

70
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:37,293
<font color="#ffff80">someone got in and
stole the corpse.</font>

71
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:40,293
<font color="#ffff80">- Are you sure no one broke in?
- No. I'm quite sure.</font>

72
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,668
<font color="#ffff80">But we can't get into
the security room,</font>

73
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:45,668
<font color="#ffff80">someone's changed the code.</font>

74
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,543
<font color="#ffff80">The science team.</font>

75
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,709
<font color="#ffff80">- You talk to them.
- Okay.</font>

76
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:56,959
<font color="#ffff80">What do we know about her?</font>

77
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:00,793
<font color="#ffff80">Married to Alex Ulloa,
director of Farmatech,</font>

78
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:04,084
<font color="#ffff80">a pharmaceutical
lab that she owns.</font>

79
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:08,959
<font color="#ffff80">She also had controlling shares in
some thriving technological firms.</font>

80
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:11,126
<font color="#ffff80">No children.</font>

81
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:15,209
<font color="#ffff80">And she owned other businesses
with her two sisters,</font>

82
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:18,543
<font color="#ffff80">Luna and Gloria Villaverde.</font>

83
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:23,084
<font color="#ffff80">The report says she just came
back from a business trip to L.A.</font>

84
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:26,043
<font color="#ffff80">A powerful woman.</font>

85
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:28,918
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka Villaverde Freire,</font>

86
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,668
<font color="#ffff80">do you take Alex Ulloa Marcos</font>

87
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:35,501
<font color="#ffff80">as your lawful wedded husband
till death do you part?</font>

88
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:38,709
<font color="#ffff80">No.</font>

89
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:47,501
<font color="#ffff80">I don't want to marry you, Alex.</font>

90
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:50,709
<font color="#ffff80">- What do you mean?
- Not like this.</font>

91
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:53,501
<font color="#ffff80">My whole family's here!</font>

92
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:56,668
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka, please...</font>

93
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,251
<font color="#ffff80">Darling!</font>

94
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:02,168
<font color="#ffff80">Of course I do!</font>

95
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:13,793
<font color="#ffff80">Only she could do that
and get us to applaud.</font>

96
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:16,626
<font color="#ffff80">And the groom to kiss her.</font>

97
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:19,959
<font color="#ffff80">I'll get it.</font>

98
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:23,834
<font color="#ffff80">Yes?</font>

99
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:25,626
<font color="#ffff80">Hello, Dad.</font>

100
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,709
<font color="#ffff80">No, you'd better
call him tomorrow.</font>

101
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:31,793
<font color="#ffff80">He's in the bedroom. He doesn't
want to talk to anyone.</font>

102
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,293
<font color="#ffff80">He's shattered.</font>

103
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:38,834
<font color="#ffff80">He found her when he
got back from the lab.</font>

104
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:40,793
<font color="#ffff80">A heart attack.</font>

105
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:43,751
<font color="#ffff80">Mum's dress was perfect on her.</font>

106
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,376
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka was perfect.</font>

107
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:48,376
<font color="#ffff80">You may kiss the bride.</font>

108
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:04,834
<font color="#ffff80">Alex.</font>

109
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,834
<font color="#ffff80">Alex.</font>

110
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:15,876
<font color="#ffff80">Dad called. He sends you a kiss.</font>

111
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:21,834
<font color="#ffff80">We'll leave you alone, okay?</font>

112
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,376
<font color="#ffff80">I need to rest.</font>

113
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:36,209
<font color="#ffff80">- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't take any more.</font>

114
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:38,959
<font color="#ffff80">- You could've called.
- Nobody saw me.</font>

115
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,168
<font color="#ffff80">Is something wrong?</font>

116
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:47,209
<font color="#ffff80">- Is everything alright?
- Yes.</font>

117
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:50,376
<font color="#ffff80">- It's done. I did it for you.
- There's no going back.</font>

118
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:53,501
<font color="#ffff80">I'm free to be with you.
We're free.</font>

119
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:13,209
<font color="#ffff80">- What can I get you?
- I don't care, whatever you're having.</font>

120
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:22,959
<font color="#ffff80">What were you doing?</font>

121
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:24,126
<font color="#ffff80">Nothing.</font>

122
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:28,751
<font color="#ffff80">Thinking.</font>

123
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:31,418
<font color="#ffff80">- About what?
- What do you think?</font>

124
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:01,168
<font color="#ffff80">Why don't you answer it?</font>

125
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:04,251
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know who it is. The
condolences keep coming.</font>

126
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,334
<font color="#ffff80">It's unbearable.</font>

127
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:08,043
<font color="#ffff80">At this hour?</font>

128
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:12,834
<font color="#ffff80">Yes?</font>

129
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,793
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, that's me.</font>

130
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:18,501
<font color="#ffff80">Don't worry, I was awake.</font>

131
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:22,876
<font color="#ffff80">I spoke to your colleague.
This afternoon, yes.</font>

132
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,084
<font color="#ffff80">What do you mean "disappeared"?</font>

133
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:42,376
<font color="#ffff80">That's impossible, it's...</font>

134
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:48,043
<font color="#ffff80">Alright, alright. Thanks.</font>

135
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:49,834
<font color="#ffff80">I'll be right there.</font>

136
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,126
<font color="#ffff80">- Who was that?
- The police.</font>

137
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:56,334
<font color="#ffff80">- Didn't you speak to them already?
- Mayka's disappeared.</font>

138
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:57,209
<font color="#ffff80">What?</font>

139
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:00,251
<font color="#ffff80">Her body's disappeared
from the morgue.</font>

140
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:02,918
<font color="#ffff80">- Disappeared? How?
- Disappeared. I don't know.</font>

141
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:05,793
<font color="#ffff80">- She is dead, isn't she?
- Of course she is.</font>

142
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,418
<font color="#ffff80">Are you sure?</font>

143
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,584
<font color="#ffff80">I know what I did and how.
She's dead.</font>

144
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,793
<font color="#ffff80">Someone must've taken her.</font>

145
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,959
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know, I only know
what the police are saying.</font>

146
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:22,251
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe it's a mistake,
they'll probably apologize.</font>

147
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,959
<font color="#ffff80">- Do you have to go?
- Of course I do.</font>

148
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:35,459
<font color="#ffff80">Don%go.</font>

149
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,668
<font color="#ffff80">It might be dangerous. What if
they're suspicious and it's a trap?</font>

150
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:42,293
<font color="#ffff80">They've no reason
to be suspicious.</font>

151
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:44,543
<font color="#ffff80">But if I don't go,
they might be.</font>

152
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:46,709
<font color="#ffff80">Come here.</font>

153
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:51,001
<font color="#ffff80">Be careful.</font>

154
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:03,084
<font color="#ffff80">Go on, you can go through.</font>

155
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:16,334
<font color="#ffff80">We're sorry to call you
with such terrible news</font>

156
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:18,959
<font color="#ffff80">and for getting you down here.
Thank you so much.</font>

157
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,543
<font color="#ffff80">What's happened, exactly?</font>

158
00:15:23,293 --> 00:15:25,709
<font color="#ffff80">Our first hypothesis...</font>

159
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,543
<font color="#ffff80">is that someone's
taken the body.</font>

160
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:33,084
<font color="#ffff80">How can this happen?</font>

161
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:37,001
<font color="#ffff80">Isn't this place meant to be secure?
There are human beings here.</font>

162
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:39,168
<font color="#ffff80">There's 24-hour surveillance.</font>

163
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:42,834
<font color="#ffff80">It's what happened to the
night guard that alerted us.</font>

164
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:46,209
<font color="#ffff80">He was run over as he
fled the morgue in fear.</font>

165
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,376
<font color="#ffff80">In fear?</font>

166
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:51,043
<font color="#ffff80">It seems he saw something related
to your wife's disappearance.</font>

167
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:52,751
<font color="#ffff80">We don't know what.</font>

168
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,959
<font color="#ffff80">He ran away and was
run over by a car.</font>

169
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:57,084
<font color="#ffff80">He's now in a coma
at Sacred Heart.</font>

170
00:15:57,251 --> 00:15:59,959
<font color="#ffff80">Where's the sense in this?
Has it happened before?</font>

171
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,793
<font color="#ffff80">There have been cases of
vandalism and organ trafficking,</font>

172
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,793
<font color="#ffff80">but we ruled those out.</font>

173
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:08,418
<font color="#ffff80">Vandals leave all
kinds of traces</font>

174
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:12,251
<font color="#ffff80">and organ traffickers
don't take just one body.</font>

175
00:16:12,751 --> 00:16:16,918
<font color="#ffff80">And, no offense, but usually
they prefer younger bodies.</font>

176
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:23,001
<font color="#ffff80">That leaves us a
Satanic cult, a sect.</font>

177
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,459
<font color="#ffff80">Your wife didn't look
like a sect member.</font>

178
00:16:28,168 --> 00:16:29,584
<font color="#ffff80">No, of course not.</font>

179
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:35,126
<font color="#ffff80">Then it has to be
more personal,...</font>

180
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:42,501
<font color="#ffff80">someone wishing to harm your
wife, even after she was dead.</font>

181
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:46,668
<font color="#ffff80">Did she have problems with
anyone, enemies of any kind?</font>

182
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:49,043
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka didn't have any
problems with anyone.</font>

183
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,668
<font color="#ffff80">She was a powerful
woman, owned companies.</font>

184
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,001
<font color="#ffff80">You can't think of anyone?</font>

185
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,084
<font color="#ffff80">To do something so
horrific, of course not.</font>

186
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:56,543
<font color="#ffff80">What about you?</font>

187
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,084
<font color="#ffff80">What about me?</font>

188
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,084
<font color="#ffff80">It sounds twisted, but would
anyone want to hurt you</font>

189
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:05,751
<font color="#ffff80">with something as macabre
as making your wife vanish?</font>

190
00:17:05,918 --> 00:17:09,001
<font color="#ffff80">I've no idea why this is happening.
I have no enemies.</font>

191
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:13,668
<font color="#ffff80">If it's not you, perhaps they
want to hurt some family member.</font>

192
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:16,959
<font color="#ffff80">- You should ask Mayka's sisters.
- We've done that.</font>

193
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:19,376
<font color="#ffff80">Did you call them before me?</font>

194
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:23,668
<font color="#ffff80">We located them at home, but
neither of them knows anything.</font>

195
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,126
<font color="#ffff80">The lawyer...</font>

196
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:28,959
<font color="#ffff80">Gloria.</font>

197
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:32,293
<font color="#ffff80">...Gave us these papers.</font>

198
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:35,084
<font color="#ffff80">We might find something,
and we might not.</font>

199
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:39,876
<font color="#ffff80">Of course we tried
to find you first,</font>

200
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:41,376
<font color="#ffff80">but you weren't home,</font>

201
00:17:41,918 --> 00:17:44,418
<font color="#ffff80">so we called your mobile.</font>

202
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,959
<font color="#ffff80">Gloria gave us your number.</font>

203
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:51,168
<font color="#ffff80">I went out for some painkillers,
my head was about to explode.</font>

204
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:54,709
<font color="#ffff80">Feeling any better?</font>

205
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:57,084
<font color="#ffff80">Yes. Thanks a lot.</font>

206
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:02,084
<font color="#ffff80">Dr. Tapia's here.</font>

207
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:09,584
<font color="#ffff80">We'll be right back.</font>

208
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:35,084
<font color="#ffff80">Yes?</font>

209
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:36,751
<font color="#ffff80">Why didn't you pick up?</font>

210
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:40,168
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry, I thought the
police might have your mobile.</font>

211
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:42,209
<font color="#ffff80">Nobody took my mobile.
Everything's fine.</font>

212
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:43,293
<font color="#ffff80">Has she turned up?</font>

213
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:45,543
<font color="#ffff80">No, but she will. I need
you to do something.</font>

214
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,376
<font color="#ffff80">What do you want me to do?</font>

215
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,959
<font color="#ffff80">The guard saw something,
ran away and got run over.</font>

216
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:51,793
<font color="#ffff80">He's unconscious
in Intensive Care.</font>

217
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:55,084
<font color="#ffff80">The police say they don't know what
he saw, but I don't trust them.</font>

218
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:56,918
<font color="#ffff80">Do you know anyone
at Sacred Heart?</font>

219
00:18:57,251 --> 00:18:58,834
<font color="#ffff80">Alex, what are you asking?</font>

220
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:01,334
<font color="#ffff80">The guard's there. Do you
know someone or not?</font>

221
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:03,334
<font color="#ffff80">I did practicals
there last year.</font>

222
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:06,793
<font color="#ffff80">Go there and find out what you can
without raising any suspicion.</font>

223
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,334
<font color="#ffff80">Can't you go? You must
know people at their lab.</font>

224
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:10,793
<font color="#ffff80">I can't move from here.</font>

225
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,626
<font color="#ffff80">- Are you under arrest?
- Of course not.</font>

226
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:18,293
<font color="#ffff80">But they want to question me. I'll
call when I can. Love you. Ciao.</font>

227
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:19,418
<font color="#ffff80">I love you t...</font>

228
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,918
<font color="#ffff80">You can't smoke here.</font>

229
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,793
<font color="#ffff80">In this situation can't
you turn a blind eye?</font>

230
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:41,418
<font color="#ffff80">The forensic wants
to talk to you.</font>

231
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:44,959
<font color="#ffff80">In your statement you say</font>

232
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:48,126
<font color="#ffff80">your wife returned from L.A. this morning.
Is that right?</font>

233
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:51,043
<font color="#ffff80">- Yes. A business trip.
- I see she had a fear of flying.</font>

234
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:54,168
<font color="#ffff80">She'd done various therapies.
Why?</font>

235
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:58,209
<font color="#ffff80">Stress on long flights can
cause cardiac arrest.</font>

236
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,293
<font color="#ffff80">You think Mayka had a cardiac
because of the trip?</font>

237
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:04,418
<font color="#ffff80">There is that possibility.</font>

238
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:08,584
<font color="#ffff80">Though we have no record of
any cardiovascular hazard.</font>

239
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:10,959
<font color="#ffff80">Perhaps it wasn't detected.</font>

240
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,251
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know, you're the expert.</font>

241
00:20:15,084 --> 00:20:18,668
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka thought she was invincible.
Perhaps that takes its toll.</font>

242
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:22,668
<font color="#ffff80">Perhaps.</font>

243
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:31,709
<font color="#ffff80">But without an autopsy
it's impossible to verify.</font>

244
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:34,084
<font color="#ffff80">Any schizophrenic episode?</font>

245
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:35,876
<font color="#ffff80">No.</font>

246
00:20:36,043 --> 00:20:37,793
<font color="#ffff80">- Parkinson's?
- Not that either.</font>

247
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:38,918
<font color="#ffff80">Epilepsy?</font>

248
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:41,501
<font color="#ffff80">It's all in her medical file.
I don't get it.</font>

249
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:44,543
<font color="#ffff80">The doctors didn't live with her.
You did.</font>

250
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:47,543
<font color="#ffff80">I don't get what this has to do
with my wife's disappearance.</font>

251
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,543
<font color="#ffff80">I'd like to rule out a theory
that'd explain what happened.</font>

252
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,084
<font color="#ffff80">What?</font>

253
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:56,626
<font color="#ffff80">Catalepsy.</font>

254
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:58,293
<font color="#ffff80">What did you say?</font>

255
00:21:07,084 --> 00:21:08,293
<font color="#ffff80">Alright, Silvia...</font>

256
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:12,001
<font color="#ffff80">Do you really think it's possible
the corpse wasn't a corpse?</font>

257
00:21:12,168 --> 00:21:14,959
<font color="#ffff80">I certified her death and
I did my job properly,</font>

258
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:17,626
<font color="#ffff80">but circumstances force me
to reconsider everything.</font>

259
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:19,751
<font color="#ffff80">It makes no sense.
If she woke up,</font>

260
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:22,334
<font color="#ffff80">why not cry out for help?
Why disappear?</font>

261
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:25,668
<font color="#ffff80">He's right. It's more logical
that someone came for her.</font>

262
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:28,209
<font color="#ffff80">And from a medical
viewpoint, more probable.</font>

263
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:31,959
<font color="#ffff80">Then let's return to the 21st century
and assume that the cause of death</font>

264
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:35,251
<font color="#ffff80">was heart attack, as in
your preliminary report.</font>

265
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:38,918
<font color="#ffff80">The question is: why
was the body taken?</font>

266
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:43,043
<font color="#ffff80">There's a principle
in forensic medicine:</font>

267
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:46,918
<font color="#ffff80">"Every death is a homicide
until proven otherwise."</font>

268
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,751
<font color="#ffff80">Cardiac arrest can be induced</font>

269
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:52,376
<font color="#ffff80">by submitting a person
to extreme tension.</font>

270
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:56,293
<font color="#ffff80">Or administering substances
that have the same result.</font>

271
00:21:57,126 --> 00:21:59,543
<font color="#ffff80">But nothing's demonstrable
without an autopsy.</font>

272
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,209
<font color="#ffff80">And no body, no autopsy.</font>

273
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:13,626
<font color="#ffff80">What did you think
when you spoke to him?</font>

274
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:17,376
<font color="#ffff80">I was surprised how he
referred to his wife.</font>

275
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:20,918
<font color="#ffff80">He spoke about her in the
past, with no hesitation.</font>

276
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:23,876
<font color="#ffff80">Ruth died several years ago...</font>

277
00:22:24,668 --> 00:22:27,668
<font color="#ffff80">and I still talk about her
as if she were alive.</font>

278
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,376
<font color="#ffff80">His wife died this afternoon.</font>

279
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:38,376
<font color="#ffff80">I'll find out
everything about him.</font>

280
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,709
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry you had to come
at this time of night.</font>

281
00:23:01,668 --> 00:23:03,501
<font color="#ffff80">And in this weather.</font>

282
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,626
<font color="#ffff80">Pablo tells me you came
back from a trip today,</font>

283
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:08,376
<font color="#ffff80">to see Eva.</font>

284
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:13,334
<font color="#ffff80">I hope she's alright.</font>

285
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,043
<font color="#ffff80">She's fine.</font>

286
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:16,793
<font color="#ffff80">Or seems to be at least.</font>

287
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:19,084
<font color="#ffff80">And you?</font>

288
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:22,001
<font color="#ffff80">How are you?</font>

289
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:24,251
<font color="#ffff80">They told you everything.</font>

290
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:27,251
<font color="#ffff80">I heard you were
suspended again,</font>

291
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,501
<font color="#ffff80">you went into therapy again...</font>

292
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:31,418
<font color="#ffff80">I fell off the wagon.</font>

293
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:34,501
<font color="#ffff80">But I only drink coffee now.</font>

294
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:37,918
<font color="#ffff80">7 months on coffee, I'm
a gourmet about it.</font>

295
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,418
<font color="#ffff80">Try switching to teas.</font>

296
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:42,584
<font color="#ffff80">Your heart will thank you.</font>

297
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:45,584
<font color="#ffff80">My heart's withstood much worse.</font>

298
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:50,376
<font color="#ffff80">You'd be doing yourself a favour
if you put it behind you.</font>

299
00:23:50,543 --> 00:23:52,876
<font color="#ffff80">When will you stop
blaming yourself?</font>

300
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:54,876
<font color="#ffff80">It's been a long time.</font>

301
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:58,751
<font color="#ffff80">It was a night like tonight.</font>

302
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:06,293
<font color="#ffff80">I'm alone now, Silvia.</font>

303
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:09,793
<font color="#ffff80">No.</font>

304
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,668
<font color="#ffff80">You're not.</font>

305
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:26,251
<font color="#ffff80">What's wrong?</font>

306
00:24:26,918 --> 00:24:29,793
<font color="#ffff80">- Where is everyone?
- Go back inside.</font>

307
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:31,709
<font color="#ffff80">- Have you seen the time?
- Yeah.</font>

308
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:34,376
<font color="#ffff80">- You know what a day I've had?
- We're working on...</font>

309
00:24:34,543 --> 00:24:38,084
<font color="#ffff80">Listen, please. Tell your
boss I want to go home.</font>

310
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:39,876
<font color="#ffff80">Be patient.</font>

311
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:46,459
<font color="#ffff80">I'll see what's happening.</font>

312
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,418
<font color="#ffff80">Please, call your boss.</font>

313
00:24:49,584 --> 00:24:52,293
<font color="#ffff80">Please, Mr. Ulloa, go
back into the office.</font>

314
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:54,001
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">Mayka.</font>

316
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:35,918
<font color="#ffff80">Thanks.</font>

317
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:39,834
<font color="#ffff80">What about yours?</font>

318
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:43,626
<font color="#ffff80">- It's 9 in the morning.
- Not in Los Angeles.</font>

319
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:47,084
<font color="#ffff80">And I want to toast to
the trip's success.</font>

320
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:50,084
<font color="#ffff80">And...</font>

321
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:52,834
<font color="#ffff80">...to my return.</font>

322
00:28:02,543 --> 00:28:05,209
<font color="#ffff80">- Will this toast do you?
- No.</font>

323
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:08,918
<font color="#ffff80">The lab called, I have to go.</font>

324
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:11,501
<font color="#ffff80">Alex...</font>

325
00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:16,126
<font color="#ffff80">We've been apart for 3 weeks.
We have to talk.</font>

326
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:17,793
<font color="#ffff80">I've got a meeting.</font>

327
00:28:20,418 --> 00:28:23,584
<font color="#ffff80">You're the Director, you
can do what you like.</font>

328
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:25,418
<font color="#ffff80">No one can fire you.</font>

329
00:28:27,376 --> 00:28:29,209
<font color="#ffff80">Except me.</font>

330
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:31,959
<font color="#ffff80">You know something?</font>

331
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:34,501
<font color="#ffff80">I don't like this kind of joke.</font>

332
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:38,126
<font color="#ffff80">I work hard because I take
what I do very seriously.</font>

333
00:28:38,334 --> 00:28:40,168
<font color="#ffff80">And I do it because I like it.</font>

334
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:42,168
<font color="#ffff80">I know.</font>

335
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:47,293
<font color="#ffff80">That's why you're where you are,
and not teaching at a college.</font>

336
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:49,501
<font color="#ffff80">I don't want to leave angry.</font>

337
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:53,709
<font color="#ffff80">See you later, okay?</font>

338
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:40,668
<font color="#ffff80">Hello. Cristina?</font>

339
00:29:41,251 --> 00:29:44,251
<font color="#ffff80">Please call and tell them
Alex can't make the meeting.</font>

340
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:47,001
<font color="#ffff80">No, he's fine.</font>

341
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:48,876
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka... What are you doing?</font>

342
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:51,918
<font color="#ffff80">What's more, he won't be
returning to the lab.</font>

343
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:53,543
<font color="#ffff80">Get a letter of dismissal
ready for him.</font>

344
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:54,876
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka... Mayka!</font>

345
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,418
<font color="#ffff80">Of course!</font>

346
00:29:56,584 --> 00:29:59,251
<font color="#ffff80">- What are you doing?
- Of course I'm serious.</font>

347
00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:02,834
<font color="#ffff80">It's my company. It's my
decision and I've just made it.</font>

348
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,918
<font color="#ffff80">Thanks.</font>

349
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:10,793
<font color="#ffff80">We'll sort it out
this afternoon,</font>

350
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:14,084
<font color="#ffff80">but now we have the whole
morning to ourselves.</font>

351
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:15,376
<font color="#ffff80">Come here...</font>

352
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:17,668
<font color="#ffff80">Alex?</font>

00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:25,293
<font color="#ffff80">Darling!</font>

354
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,584
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't speak to anyone!</font>

355
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:31,084
<font color="#ffff80">You're like a child.</font>

356
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,251
<font color="#ffff80">I'll book a table somewhere
for dinner when you get out.</font>

357
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:42,834
<font color="#ffff80">You'll be sleepy...</font>

358
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:45,543
<font color="#ffff80">from the jet lag.</font>

359
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:47,709
<font color="#ffff80">I'll be awake.</font>

360
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:50,501
<font color="#ffff80">Tell me when you want the table.</font>

- What are you doing here?</font>

<font color="#ffff80">The fuses blew, but
it's fixed now.</font>

366
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:18,709
<font color="#ffff80">What...?</font>

367
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:24,459
<font color="#ffff80">It's the box with the
deceased's personal items.</font>

368
00:31:26,376 --> 00:31:28,001
<font color="#ffff80">They were in this locker.</font>

369
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:34,376
<font color="#ffff80">The lock's been jimmied.</font>

370

your wife's things?</font>

371
00:31:39,043 --> 00:31:41,084
<font color="#ffff80">No, I didn't touch anything.</font>

372
00:31:41,251 --> 00:31:45,626
<font color="#ffff80">According to the delivery note,
the mobile phone's missing.</font>

373

374
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:49,543
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't take anything.</font>

375

<font color="#ffff80">Who was it then?</font>

376
00:31:51,584 --> 00:31:52,876
<font color="#ffff80">One of the dead?</font>

377

to liven up our night?</font>

my wife's mobile?</font>

going to throw it out.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">- Like what?
- It's not my specialty.</font>

404
00:33:57,626 --> 00:33:59,043
<font color="#ffff80">It's his.</font>

405
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,334
<font color="#ffff80">Answer it.</font>

406
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:08,959
<font color="#ffff80">My sister.</font>

407
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:13,834
<font color="#ffff80">Yes?</font>

408
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:15,793
<font color="#ffff80">I'm at the hospital. The
guard's name is Angel Torres.</font>

409
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:19,168
<font color="#ffff80">I'm fine. Mayka's still missing,
but the police will find her.</font>

410
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:22,334
<font color="#ffff80">You can't talk. Something's wrong,
I can hear it in your voice.</font>

411
00:34:22,501 --> 00:34:24,584
<font color="#ffff80">Thanks, Erica. I'll
call you later.</font>

412
00:34:26,126 --> 00:34:27,751
<font color="#ffff80">Have we finished?</font>

413
00:34:28,293 --> 00:34:31,126
<font color="#ffff80">We'll go over your statement,
then you can go home.</font>

414
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:32,918
<font color="#ffff80">Can I go to the bathroom first?</font>

415
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:38,168
<font color="#ffff80">I'll wait here.</font>

416
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:46,709
<font color="#ffff80">Alex</font>

417
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,793
<font color="#ffff80">I haven't much time.
What did you find out?</font>

418
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:52,001
<font color="#ffff80">The guard's still unconscious,
they only know what you were told.</font>

419
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:53,793
<font color="#ffff80">I know a nurse on that floor.</font>

420
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,251
<font color="#ffff80">She thinks I'm spending the
night with a relative.</font>

421
00:34:56,418 --> 00:35:00,501
<font color="#ffff80">She's on a break in 20 minutes.
I'm meeting her in a bar nearby.</font>

422
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:02,209
<font color="#ffff80">I think somebody
knows something.</font>

423
00:35:03,209 --> 00:35:06,543
<font color="#ffff80">- Who? The police?
- The police don't worry me.</font>

424
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:10,084
<font color="#ffff80">Someone forced the locker with
Mayka's things and taken her phone.</font>

425
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:11,668
<font color="#ffff80">Fuck.</font>

426
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:16,001
<font color="#ffff80">And the TH-16 I hid today has turned up.
The police have it.</font>

427
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:17,543
<font color="#ffff80">It's a trap.</font>

428
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:20,251
<font color="#ffff80">- I told you not to go.
- I can handle the police.</font>

429
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:24,084
<font color="#ffff80">How could anyone know anything?
Only you and I knew.</font>

430
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:26,834
<font color="#ffff80">Did you talk to anyone?</font>

431
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:29,084
<font color="#ffff80">- What?
- I need to know.</font>

432
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:31,001
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't talk to anyone,
I'm not an idiot.</font>

433
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:33,001
<font color="#ffff80">Something's gone wrong.
I know what I'm doing.</font>

434
00:35:33,168 --> 00:35:36,001
<font color="#ffff80">You lived with her. Your wife saw
you every day since you decided.</font>

435
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:39,668
<font color="#ffff80">We decided. I've
calculated my every move.</font>

436
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:42,043
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe you talk in your
sleep, I don't know!</font>

437
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:43,418
<font color="#ffff80">What'll you do?</font>

438
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:46,126
<font color="#ffff80">Try to get out of here. But
think about what I said.</font>

439
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:49,209
<font color="#ffff80">We have to find out what happened
to Mayka and why. Alright?</font>

440
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:51,459
<font color="#ffff80">Alright. Alex...</font>

441
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:53,918
<font color="#ffff80">I love you.</font>

442
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,376
<font color="#ffff80">And I love you.</font>

443
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:13,876
<font color="#ffff80">Dr. Tapia told me.</font>

444
00:36:14,918 --> 00:36:16,876
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry I didn't remember...</font>

445
00:36:18,251 --> 00:36:19,543
<font color="#ffff80">...about Ruth.</font>

446
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:24,834
<font color="#ffff80">Why don't you go home? I'll
cover for you, nobody'll know.</font>

447
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:26,751
<font color="#ffff80">I lost it before.</font>

448
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:29,376
<font color="#ffff80">It won't happen again.</font>

449
00:36:29,543 --> 00:36:31,793
<font color="#ffff80">That's what you said last time.</font>

450
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:46,626
<font color="#ffff80">BUSINESS CLUB ANNUAL
DINNER HOTEL TIVOLI, 8:30</font>

YOU'RE STILL WITH ME</font>

452
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:30,793

453
00:38:34,001 --> 00:38:35,334
<font color="#ffff80">Don't tell me...</font>

454
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:39,543
<font color="#ffff80">- You forgot about the dinner.
- There was a setback at the lab.</font>

455
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:45,001
<font color="#ffff80">I called. Cristina said you
weren't at the lab all afternoon.</font>

456
00:38:45,168 --> 00:38:46,376
<font color="#ffff80">I went to get some samples.</font>

457
00:38:46,543 --> 00:38:49,334
<font color="#ffff80">I was out of the office and
I couldn't advise Cristina.</font>

458
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:51,126
<font color="#ffff80">I also called your mobile.</font>

459
00:38:51,918 --> 00:38:55,251
<font color="#ffff80">It was in my briefcase.
I left it in my car.</font>

460
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,251
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't see your calls, sorry.</font>

461

<font color="#ffff80">Hold on.</font>

462
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:04,626
<font color="#ffff80">You have something...</font>

463
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,959
<font color="#ffff80">- What?
- Here.</font>

464
00:39:09,668 --> 00:39:12,251
<font color="#ffff80">A freckle I've
never seen before.</font>

465
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:18,751
<font color="#ffff80">Put on that grey suit I got you.
You'll look so handsome.</font>

466
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:22,126
<font color="#ffff80">I was going to wear
the new blue one.</font>

467
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:26,126
<font color="#ffff80">I'll have a shower. We
can leave in 5 minutes.</font>

468
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:36,209
<font color="#ffff80">I find it hard to accept...</font>

469
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:48,293
<font color="#ffff80">...that I'm not so
young any more.</font>

470
00:39:49,543 --> 00:39:52,251
<font color="#ffff80">- We all get older.
- Sure.</font>

471
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:56,084
<font color="#ffff80">But you're the one who's
starting to get home late.</font>

472
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:02,043
<font color="#ffff80">- What's wrong?
- Nothing. The song made me sad.</font>

473
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:07,501

474
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:10,251
<font color="#ffff80">And that makes you sad?</font>

- Tell me it's just a song!</font>

<font color="#ffff80">It's just a song.</font>

479
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,084
<font color="#ffff80">Tell me I'm not
going to lose you.</font>

480
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:26,876
<font color="#ffff80">You'll never lose me, ever.</font>

481
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:29,084
<font color="#ffff80">Never</font>

482

<font color="#ffff80">I CLOSE MY EYES AND
YOU'RE STILL WITH ME.</font>

483
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:13,043

me, we have news.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">What the hell are you doing?</font>

487
00:42:38,334 --> 00:42:39,459
<font color="#ffff80">Fuck.</font>

488
00:42:44,793 --> 00:42:46,293

<font color="#ffff80">- I'll be right out.
- You now you can't smoke here?</font>

490
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:52,293

491
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:55,959
<font color="#ffff80">I'm coming.</font>

492
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,668
<font color="#ffff80">What is it?</font>

493
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:02,543
<font color="#ffff80">A clue.</font>

494
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:19,834
<font color="#ffff80">- Got the new code yet?
- I'm offended you ask.</font>

495
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:22,418
<font color="#ffff80">Jaime's inside now. Pablo's
still on the rooftop.</font>

496
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:23,918
<font color="#ffff80">This way, Mr. Ulloa.</font>

497
00:43:37,334 --> 00:43:39,043
<font color="#ffff80">What do you want me to see?</font>

498
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:41,126
<font color="#ffff80">The inspector will fill you in.</font>

499
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:44,251
<font color="#ffff80">Where are we?</font>

500
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:56,293
<font color="#ffff80">The whole building is
controlled from here.</font>

501
00:43:57,418 --> 00:43:59,418
<font color="#ffff80">The security cameras too.</font>

502
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:02,043
<font color="#ffff80">But there's a weak spot.</font>

503
00:44:11,334 --> 00:44:14,918
<font color="#ffff80">The air duct leads
to the rooftop.</font>

504
00:44:16,543 --> 00:44:18,959
<font color="#ffff80">It's been forced at both ends.</font>

505
00:44:19,334 --> 00:44:23,043
<font color="#ffff80">Someone got in here to cut
the surveillance circuits.</font>

506
00:44:23,209 --> 00:44:26,418
<font color="#ffff80">He could've reached the fridge
and taken your wife's body.</font>

507
00:44:26,584 --> 00:44:28,668
<font color="#ffff80">- Pablo, do you read me?
- Norma, what is it?</font>

508
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:32,001
<font color="#ffff80">I'm at the emergency stairs
leading to the rooftop.</font>

509
00:44:33,376 --> 00:44:35,043
<font color="#ffff80">We've found something.</font>

510
00:44:35,793 --> 00:44:37,626
<font color="#ffff80">20 March, 2012.</font>

511
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:40,626
<font color="#ffff80">Does that date mean
anything to you?</font>

512
00:44:42,043 --> 00:44:43,376
<font color="#ffff80">No. Why?</font>

513
00:44:43,959 --> 00:44:46,709
<font color="#ffff80">Someone changed the
date on the calendar.</font>

514
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:53,459
<font color="#ffff80">Most likely the person who
took your wife's body.</font>

515
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:58,793
<font color="#ffff80">From here the only way out
is this security door.</font>

516
00:44:58,959 --> 00:45:00,793
<font color="#ffff80">To do that, you have
to key in a code.</font>

517
00:45:01,376 --> 00:45:04,126
<font color="#ffff80">The control panel's
been manipulated.</font>

518
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:07,834
<font color="#ffff80">The code was changed tonight.</font>

519
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:10,293
<font color="#ffff80">Guess what it is.</font>

520
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:15,376
<font color="#ffff80">20-03-2012.</font>

- CARLA.</font>

523

524
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:04,334
<font color="#ffff80">What are you doing here?</font>

525
00:46:05,001 --> 00:46:07,376
<font color="#ffff80">Nice to see you too.</font>

526
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:09,751
<font color="#ffff80">Cristina opened up for me.</font>

527
00:46:10,251 --> 00:46:12,543
<font color="#ffff80">Don't you dare get mad at her.</font>

528
00:46:13,043 --> 00:46:15,209
<font color="#ffff80">I thought you were
coming back tomorrow.</font>

529
00:46:16,209 --> 00:46:18,709
<font color="#ffff80">I squeezed the
meetings into one day.</font>

530
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,293
<font color="#ffff80">I have to make a note
before I forget.</font>

531
00:46:27,293 --> 00:46:28,709
<font color="#ffff80">I saw you.</font>

532
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:33,334
<font color="#ffff80">Keying in the code.</font>

533
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:35,126
<font color="#ffff80">Were you spying on me?</font>

534
00:46:36,334 --> 00:46:38,043
<font color="#ffff80">Why did you choose that date?</font>

535
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:39,709
<font color="#ffff80">How do you know it's a date?</font>

536
00:46:39,876 --> 00:46:41,459
<font color="#ffff80">Darling...</font>

537
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:45,459
<font color="#ffff80">You put dates on everything.</font>

538
00:46:47,459 --> 00:46:49,209
<font color="#ffff80">Even the bad days.</font>

539
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:54,126
<font color="#ffff80">It's a way of remembering.</font>

540
00:46:54,293 --> 00:46:56,126
<font color="#ffff80">Some things are best forgotten.</font>

541
00:46:56,293 --> 00:46:57,834
<font color="#ffff80">I like to remember.</font>

542
00:47:07,209 --> 00:47:09,459
<font color="#ffff80">Are you going to tell me
what happened that day?</font>

543
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,209
<font color="#ffff80">We argued, and you know I
don't like arguing with you.</font>

544
00:47:12,376 --> 00:47:14,918
<font color="#ffff80">IdonTHke being
contradicted either.</font>

545
00:47:22,251 --> 00:47:23,918
<font color="#ffff80">Shall we have lunch?</font>

546
00:47:27,501 --> 00:47:30,293
<font color="#ffff80">- You've got plans.
- You should've warned me.</font>

547
00:47:30,876 --> 00:47:33,501
<font color="#ffff80">I can have lunch with
you and your plans.</font>

548
00:47:33,668 --> 00:47:35,793
<font color="#ffff80">I'll cancel them on the
way to the restaurant.</font>

549
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:38,251
<font color="#ffff80">- Shall we go in your car?
- No.</font>

550
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:48,376
<font color="#ffff80">Trust me.</font>

551
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:52,834
<font color="#ffff80">What are you doing?</font>

552
00:47:55,126 --> 00:47:57,001
<font color="#ffff80">Beautiful day, isn't it?</font>

553
00:48:00,334 --> 00:48:03,376
<font color="#ffff80">From now on I want us to
enjoy every beautiful day...</font>

554
00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:06,168
<font color="#ffff80">...like this.</font>

555
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:09,751
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka...</font>

556
00:48:11,126 --> 00:48:12,626
<font color="#ffff80">It's the one you liked.</font>

557
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:15,459
<font color="#ffff80">Black and chrome.</font>

558
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,959
<font color="#ffff80">- It's beautiful.
- Yes.</font>

559
00:48:18,293 --> 00:48:20,043
<font color="#ffff80">Cristina has the helmets.</font>

560
00:48:20,209 --> 00:48:22,251
<font color="#ffff80">I want you to take the
first ride with me...</font>

561
00:48:22,876 --> 00:48:24,126
<font color="#ffff80">...now.</font>

562
00:48:29,418 --> 00:48:31,501
<font color="#ffff80">Whoever took your wife's body</font>

563
00:48:31,668 --> 00:48:34,584
<font color="#ffff80">got up to the morgue
via this goods lift.</font>

564
00:48:34,876 --> 00:48:37,626
<font color="#ffff80">And got the body out
using the same lift.</font>

565
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,168
<font color="#ffff80">So, mystery solved.</font>

566
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:45,918
<font color="#ffff80">We just need to find
out who it was.</font>

567
00:48:46,668 --> 00:48:48,126
<font color="#ffff80">Do you have a clue?</font>

568
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,793
<font color="#ffff80">I've just been told that
footprints have been found</font>

569
00:48:51,959 --> 00:48:54,751
<font color="#ffff80">near the emergency stairs
going up to the rooftop.</font>

570
00:48:56,584 --> 00:48:58,168
<font color="#ffff80">What's your shoe size?</font>

571
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:02,668
<font color="#ffff80">- What?
- What's your shoe size?</font>

572
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:04,918
<font color="#ffff80">42.</font>

573
00:49:12,334 --> 00:49:15,584
<font color="#ffff80">Mateos here. What the
hell's going on?</font>

574
00:49:29,459 --> 00:49:30,668
<font color="#ffff80">Mateos, do you read me?</font>

575
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:34,543
<font color="#ffff80">A fire somewhere in the
building set the alarms off.</font>

576
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:36,293
<font color="#ffff80">Shit, man.</font>

577
00:49:38,334 --> 00:49:39,751
<font color="#ffff80">Everyone to the lobby.</font>

578
00:49:41,418 --> 00:49:42,626
<font color="#ffff80">Come on. Oh, shit.</font>

579
00:49:42,793 --> 00:49:44,043
<font color="#ffff80">Fuck!</font>

580
00:49:44,376 --> 00:49:45,376
<font color="#ffff80">Let's go!</font>

581
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:47,251
<font color="#ffff80">This way.</font>

582
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,501
<font color="#ffff80">Carla, I can't talk now.</font>

583
00:50:06,668 --> 00:50:09,001
<font color="#ffff80">- Are you still there?
- Don '1' call again. It's dangerous.</font>

584
00:50:09,168 --> 00:50:10,168
<font color="#ffff80">Why?</font>

585
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:14,043
<font color="#ffff80">Where are you?
What's that noise?</font>

586
00:50:14,209 --> 00:50:15,459
<font color="#ffff80">In the car.</font>

587
00:50:15,626 --> 00:50:18,376
<font color="#ffff80">I went out for a smoke. The
guard's still unconscious.</font>

588
00:50:18,543 --> 00:50:19,376
<font color="#ffff80">What's going on?</font>

589
00:50:19,543 --> 00:50:21,709
<font color="#ffff80">I saw the numbers on
the security camera.</font>

590
00:50:21,876 --> 00:50:23,459
<font color="#ffff80">It's the date when we met.</font>

591
00:50:25,418 --> 00:50:28,918
<font color="#ffff80">What security camera, Alex? What
are you saying? The date...?</font>

592
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:30,793
<font color="#ffff80">Alex, are you still there?</font>

593
00:50:34,043 --> 00:50:36,001
<font color="#ffff80">Fuck, talk to me! Please!</font>

594
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:37,126
<font color="#ffff80">Alex!</font>

595
00:50:37,293 --> 00:50:38,876
<font color="#ffff80">I can feel her.</font>

596
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:44,043
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka's still alive.</font>

597
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:47,334
<font color="#ffff80">- You said that was impossible.
- You were right. I made a mistake.</font>

598
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:49,126
<font color="#ffff80">She's toying with me.</font>

599
00:50:49,293 --> 00:50:53,084
<font color="#ffff80">- You said it was perfect.
- It was! I don't know how she did it.</font>

600
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:54,918
<font color="#ffff80">She can't be alive, Alex</font>

601
00:50:55,084 --> 00:50:56,751
<font color="#ffff80">"I close my eyes and
you're still with me".</font>

602
00:50:56,918 --> 00:50:59,043
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka saw your message
on my mobile.</font>

603
00:50:59,834 --> 00:51:01,209
<font color="#ffff80">How do you know?</font>

604
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:03,418
<font color="#ffff80">If Mayka knows what we
did, you're in danger.</font>

605
00:51:03,584 --> 00:51:05,668
<font color="#ffff80">She's making them think I took her
body, she's incriminating me.</font>

606
00:51:05,834 --> 00:51:07,709
<font color="#ffff80">You were home when
she disappeared.</font>

607
00:51:07,876 --> 00:51:10,334
<font color="#ffff80">I was alone, my sister
only arrived after 9.</font>

608
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:12,876
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka couldn't know all that.</font>

609
00:51:13,043 --> 00:51:14,709
<font color="#ffff80">- Maybe she has help.
- From whom?</font>

610
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:17,543
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know, but her death was certified.
She can do what she likes.</font>

611
00:51:17,709 --> 00:51:19,084
<font color="#ffff80">No one can accuse her.
Don't you see?</font>

612
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:20,918
<font color="#ffff80">Fuck the money.</font>

613
00:51:21,418 --> 00:51:23,876
<font color="#ffff80">Fuck it all. Get out of
there and we'll run away.</font>

614
00:51:25,793 --> 00:51:27,793
<font color="#ffff80">Alex, do you hear me? Alex?</font>

615
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:30,543
<font color="#ffff80">I have to go. I'll
call you when I can.</font>

616
00:51:30,709 --> 00:51:32,501
<font color="#ffff80">Be careful. I love you.</font>

617
00:51:39,959 --> 00:51:41,584
<font color="#ffff80">Let me guess.</font>

618
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:48,376
<font color="#ffff80">Your sister.</font>

619
00:51:50,501 --> 00:51:52,043
<font color="#ffff80">She's worried.</font>

620
00:51:52,668 --> 00:51:54,584
<font color="#ffff80">She thinks I should go home.</font>

621
00:51:56,584 --> 00:51:57,959
<font color="#ffff80">Your mobile.</font>

622
00:51:59,751 --> 00:52:01,251
<font color="#ffff80">Please.</font>

623
00:52:10,918 --> 00:52:13,459
<font color="#ffff80">We haven't found out
anything from Ulloa's phone,</font>

624
00:52:13,626 --> 00:52:15,084
<font color="#ffff80">no info of any use to us.</font>

625
00:52:15,251 --> 00:52:17,876
<font color="#ffff80">He erased all incoming
and outgoing calls.</font>

626
00:52:18,043 --> 00:52:20,626
<font color="#ffff80">I spoke to the company
too, but no luck.</font>

627
00:52:20,793 --> 00:52:22,793
<font color="#ffff80">He's calling an unlisted number.</font>

628
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:24,959
<font color="#ffff80">It's impossible to
know who it is.</font>

629
00:52:25,126 --> 00:52:26,459
<font color="#ffff80">Any news on Norma?</font>

630
00:52:27,668 --> 00:52:28,709
<font color="#ffff80">She just got back.</font>

631
00:52:29,376 --> 00:52:30,959
<font color="#ffff80">The woods are a mess,</font>

632
00:52:31,293 --> 00:52:35,626
<font color="#ffff80">but a team's covering the
perimeter with sniffer dogs.</font>

633
00:52:35,793 --> 00:52:38,376
<font color="#ffff80">They'll set out when
the storm's over.</font>

634
00:52:39,084 --> 00:52:41,251
<font color="#ffff80">Someone set off the fire alarm.</font>

635
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:44,584
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe by starting a fire
with a butt we found</font>

636
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:47,293
<font color="#ffff80">in the bathroom,
near the sensors.</font>

637
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:53,334
<font color="#ffff80">It must be his, I smelt smoke
when I went to get him.</font>

638
00:52:54,084 --> 00:52:57,501
<font color="#ffff80">The water flooded the area. The
scientists are going nuts.</font>

639
00:52:57,668 --> 00:52:59,459
<font color="#ffff80">It's impossible to
trace anything.</font>

640
00:52:59,626 --> 00:53:01,126
<font color="#ffff80">Son of a bitch.</font>

641
00:53:01,626 --> 00:53:03,084
<font color="#ffff80">That's not all.</font>

642
00:53:05,168 --> 00:53:07,668
<font color="#ffff80">The report on TH-16 arrived.</font>

643
00:53:08,834 --> 00:53:12,793
<font color="#ffff80">It's a cardie-toxin, very
rarely used in medicines.</font>

644
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:15,918
<font color="#ffff80">It's extracted from the
fluids of certain reptiles.</font>

645
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:18,376
<font color="#ffff80">Diluted in blood,</font>

646
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:23,043
<font color="#ffff80">it causes a cardiac 8 hours after
ingestion and leaves no trace.</font>

647
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:27,293
<font color="#ffff80">We need a transfer car. I'm
taking him to the station.</font>

648
00:53:27,459 --> 00:53:29,126
<font color="#ffff80">I'll get right on it.</font>

649
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:35,418
<font color="#ffff80">Put him in a locked room,
with constant surveillance.</font>

650
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:36,668
<font color="#ffff80">Alright.</font>

651
00:53:36,834 --> 00:53:38,918
<font color="#ffff80">I'm going for a smoke,
I'll be right back.</font>

652
00:53:39,918 --> 00:53:41,334
<font color="#ffff80">And this guy...</font>

653
00:53:42,793 --> 00:53:45,001
<font color="#ffff80">- Take his cigarettes away.
- Okay.</font>

654
00:54:00,876 --> 00:54:02,251
<font color="#ffff80">Did you lock it?</font>

655
00:54:02,418 --> 00:54:05,543
<font color="#ffff80">Yes. There's just that door,
but I'm not going in there.</font>

656
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,334
<font color="#ffff80">And he can't get out.</font>

657
00:55:04,793 --> 00:55:07,084
<font color="#ffff80">Tonight you will be mine.</font>

658
00:57:16,418 --> 00:57:17,751
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka?</font>

659

<font color="#ffff80">Mayka?</font>

661

<font color="#ffff80">Is that you?</font>

662

<font color="#ffff80">Patricia, at Arabesco.</font>

665
00:58:32,793 --> 00:58:35,501
<font color="#ffff80">And no, Mayka's not here.
She forgot her phone...</font>

666
00:58:35,668 --> 00:58:37,043

- I'm fed up with this,</font>

Mayka to contact us...</font>

me how you got this phone.</font>

00:58:47,626 --> 00:58:50,543
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka was my wife. She
died this afternoon.</font>

671
00:58:50,709 --> 00:58:53,043
<font color="#ffff80">The last time I saw
her, she had her phone.</font>

672
00:58:53,209 --> 00:58:54,459
<font color="#ffff80">Excuse me?</font>

673
00:58:54,626 --> 00:58:57,543
<font color="#ffff80">My wife's dead and
you have her phone.</font>

674
00:58:57,709 --> 00:58:59,668
<font color="#ffff80">The phone was left
behind tonight.</font>

675
00:58:59,834 --> 00:59:01,626
<font color="#ffff80">I need to know who left it.
What did they look like?</font>

676
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:04,043
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know, it was
left in the bathroom.</font>

677
00:59:04,209 --> 00:59:06,376
<font color="#ffff80">How do you know it's
my wife's phone?</font>

678
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,626
<font color="#ffff80">She got calls!</font>

679
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:11,334
<font color="#ffff80">Look at her contacts and
tell me the numbers.</font>

680
00:59:14,459 --> 00:59:15,959
<font color="#ffff80">It's empty-</font>

681
00:59:16,126 --> 00:59:17,459
<font color="#ffff80">Look...</font>

682
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:20,334
<font color="#ffff80">Sorry about your wife,</font>

683
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:22,751
<font color="#ffff80">but I can't help you, it's late</font>

684
00:59:22,918 --> 00:59:24,584
<font color="#ffff80">and I'm tired.</font>

685
00:59:25,084 --> 00:59:27,209
<font color="#ffff80">Listen... Patricia.</font>

686
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:30,376
<font color="#ffff80">My wife and I came there a lot.</font>

687
00:59:30,543 --> 00:59:33,793
<font color="#ffff80">If I describe her, you can tell me
if she or someone linked to her</font>

688
00:59:33,959 --> 00:59:36,501
<font color="#ffff80">left the phone.</font>

689
00:59:36,959 --> 00:59:39,001
<font color="#ffff80">You just said your
wife was dead.</font>

690
00:59:39,668 --> 00:59:40,793
<font color="#ffff80">I know, but...</font>

691
00:59:41,376 --> 00:59:43,709
<font color="#ffff80">Don't lie to me. Don't drag
me into your problems.</font>

692
00:59:43,876 --> 00:59:44,876
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not lying.</font>

693
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,751
<font color="#ffff80">My wife may be alive.
It's complicated.</font>

694
00:59:51,126 --> 00:59:53,043
<font color="#ffff80">See if the screen
says "redirect".</font>

695
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,209
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, it does.</font>

696
00:59:58,168 --> 00:59:59,251
<font color="#ffff80">Hey. . .</font>

697
00:59:59,459 --> 01:00:00,543
<font color="#ffff80">Hello ?</font>

698
01:00:04,418 --> 01:00:05,918
<font color="#ffff80">Dickhead.</font>

699
01:00:08,334 --> 01:00:09,626
<font color="#ffff80">Arabesco...</font>

700
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:16,959
<font color="#ffff80">Ready?</font>

701
01:00:17,209 --> 01:00:19,293
<font color="#ffff80">Are you going to tell me
what we're celebrating?</font>

702
01:00:19,668 --> 01:00:23,001
<font color="#ffff80">I got an agreement to
sign the takeover.</font>

703
01:00:23,793 --> 01:00:26,126
<font color="#ffff80">In a couple of weeks
I'm going to L.A.</font>

704
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:28,334
<font color="#ffff80">- You did it.
- Yes!</font>

705
01:00:36,293 --> 01:00:38,168
<font color="#ffff80">Why don't you come with me?</font>

706
01:00:38,459 --> 01:00:41,168
<font color="#ffff80">We could escape to
Santa Catalina.</font>

707
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:44,584
<font color="#ffff80">We can book a room in Avalon.</font>

708
01:00:45,084 --> 01:00:47,168
<font color="#ffff80">We're about to
test a new patent.</font>

709
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,126
<font color="#ffff80">Excuse me a moment.</font>

710
01:01:26,376 --> 01:01:28,459
<font color="#ffff80">An appetizer while
you're waiting?</font>

711
01:01:28,626 --> 01:01:30,376
<font color="#ffff80">No, thanks, I'm fine.</font>

712
01:01:30,543 --> 01:01:32,834
<font color="#ffff80">I'll be back shortly
to take your order.</font>

713
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:50,626
<font color="#ffff80">Who's that?</font>

714
01:01:53,834 --> 01:01:54,876
<font color="#ffff80">Nobody.</font>

715
01:01:55,376 --> 01:01:57,001
<font color="#ffff80">Were you talking about me?</font>

716
01:01:59,043 --> 01:02:00,459
<font color="#ffff80">You won't like it.</font>

717
01:02:03,543 --> 01:02:05,209
<font color="#ffff80">He's my new lawyer.</font>

718
01:02:05,418 --> 01:02:06,834
<font color="#ffff80">What's wrong with Gloria?</font>

719
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:10,126
<font color="#ffff80">As well as being my sister,
she's also your lawyer,</font>

720
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:14,709
<font color="#ffff80">and I want to revise
our marriage contract.</font>

721
01:02:18,584 --> 01:02:20,584
<font color="#ffff80">The property division.</font>

722
01:02:22,459 --> 01:02:24,043
<font color="#ffff80">You can't be serious.</font>

723
01:02:24,209 --> 01:02:26,459
<font color="#ffff80">I'm always serious with you.</font>

724
01:02:27,584 --> 01:02:29,543
<font color="#ffff80">Even if I laugh at
you constantly.</font>

725
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:32,834
<font color="#ffff80">You want everyone at
your feet, don't you?</font>

726
01:02:34,043 --> 01:02:35,793
<font color="#ffff80">Not everyone.</font>

727
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,209
<font color="#ffff80">You, yes.</font>

728
01:02:43,834 --> 01:02:45,126
<font color="#ffff80">GO'[ you!</font>

729
01:02:47,376 --> 01:02:49,001
<font color="#ffff80">You handed that to
me on a platter!</font>

730
01:02:49,168 --> 01:02:50,709
<font color="#ffff80">It's not funny.</font>

731
01:02:53,959 --> 01:02:55,709
<font color="#ffff80">If he's not your
lawyer, who is he?</font>

732
01:02:57,876 --> 01:02:59,543
<font color="#ffff80">My psychoanalyst.</font>

733
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:02,084
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't know you saw
a psychoanalyst.</font>

734
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:03,543
<font color="#ffff80">There are...</font>

735
01:03:04,459 --> 01:03:06,834
<font color="#ffff80">lots of things you
don't know about me.</font>

736
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:16,418
<font color="#ffff80">You really can't come? You
won't reconsider the trip?</font>

737
01:03:52,334 --> 01:03:54,293
<font color="#ffff80">- Yes?
- Carla, it's me.</font>

738
01:03:54,459 --> 01:03:56,168
<font color="#ffff80">Where are you calling from?</font>

739
01:03:56,501 --> 01:03:57,584
<font color="#ffff80">The police have my mobile.</font>

740
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:01,043
<font color="#ffff80">They locked me in a room with another
phone, but it's no accident.</font>

741
01:04:04,251 --> 01:04:06,418
<font color="#ffff80">- What was that?
- I just got home.</font>

742
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:09,834
<font color="#ffff80">I'll wait here until you get
out, then we'll run away.</font>

743
01:04:10,834 --> 01:04:12,418
<font color="#ffff80">What's no accident?</font>

744
01:04:12,584 --> 01:04:16,084
<font color="#ffff80">The contact list has only
one number: Mayka's.</font>

745
01:04:16,793 --> 01:04:18,626
<font color="#ffff80">But her phone's still missing.</font>

746
01:04:18,793 --> 01:04:20,876
<font color="#ffff80">Who does the phone belong to?</font>

747
01:04:21,043 --> 01:04:23,876
<font color="#ffff80">Javier Alonso. I don't know who
he is, but a few weeks ago</font>

748
01:04:24,043 --> 01:04:27,001
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka saw a man in the restaurant
I just phoned called Arabesco.</font>

749
01:04:27,168 --> 01:04:29,168
<font color="#ffff80">I don't get it.</font>

750
01:04:29,543 --> 01:04:31,626
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka's number in this
mobile's contact list</font>

751
01:04:31,793 --> 01:04:33,543
<font color="#ffff80">is calling a phone
left in Arabesco.</font>

752
01:04:33,709 --> 01:04:36,459
<font color="#ffff80">- Another forgotten mobile?
- Never mind.</font>

753
01:04:37,293 --> 01:04:39,918
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka said that man was
her psychoanalyst,</font>

754
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,334
<font color="#ffff80">but she was lying.</font>

755
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:45,126
<font color="#ffff80">Now she wants me to
make the link with her,</font>

756
01:04:45,293 --> 01:04:48,334
<font color="#ffff80">Arabesco, the forgotten
phone and that man.</font>

757
01:04:48,709 --> 01:04:50,668
<font color="#ffff80">I think he's Javier Alonso.</font>

758
01:04:51,293 --> 01:04:53,209
<font color="#ffff80">But I don't know how he fits in.</font>

759
01:04:53,376 --> 01:04:57,251
<font color="#ffff80">You have to help me. His
details are on your screen.</font>

760
01:04:57,418 --> 01:05:00,293
<font color="#ffff80">When we find out who Alonso is,
we'll discover Mayka's game.</font>

761
01:05:01,043 --> 01:05:04,168
<font color="#ffff80">Where'd you get that phone?</font>

762
01:05:08,209 --> 01:05:10,709
<font color="#ffff80">I'm looking at the
corpse of Javier Alonso.</font>

763
01:05:10,876 --> 01:05:12,668
<font color="#ffff80">The mobile was in his body bag.</font>

764
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:15,418
<font color="#ffff80">Help me find out who
Javier Alonso was</font>

765
01:05:15,584 --> 01:05:17,418
<font color="#ffff80">and we'll get out of this.</font>

766
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:19,084
<font color="#ffff80">I'll tell you something.</font>

767
01:05:47,918 --> 01:05:49,418
<font color="#ffff80">Where's Eva?</font>

768
01:05:51,376 --> 01:05:53,168
<font color="#ffff80">Under observation.</font>

769
01:05:53,793 --> 01:05:55,918
<font color="#ffff80">You'd better go back to her.</font>

770
01:05:57,876 --> 01:05:59,459
<font color="#ffff80">I'm going in.</font>

771
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,876
<font color="#ffff80">She's so pretty. Go to Mummy.</font>

772
01:06:41,584 --> 01:06:43,709
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my girl... Hello, Eva</font>

773
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,376
<font color="#ffff80">Blow, sweetie</font>

774
01:06:49,501 --> 01:06:51,459
<font color="#ffff80">Look, Daddy, look at me do it.</font>

775
01:06:51,626 --> 01:06:53,709
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, honey, be careful.</font>

776
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:03,084
<font color="#ffff80">I'll talk to Pefia and
then let you know.</font>

777
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:07,834
<font color="#ffff80">The papers from
Gloria Villaverde.</font>

778
01:08:09,459 --> 01:08:11,001
<font color="#ffff80">The last page.</font>

779
01:08:14,168 --> 01:08:17,418
<font color="#ffff80">As well as being her lawyer,
she also did the accounting.</font>

780
01:08:17,584 --> 01:08:21,334
<font color="#ffff80">We checked details on this invoice,
but we haven't found him yet.</font>

781
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:24,001
<font color="#ffff80">He's not answering his
home phone or his mobile.</font>

782
01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:26,709
<font color="#ffff80">His office is in his home.
I'll go there with a team.</font>

783
01:08:26,876 --> 01:08:28,209
<font color="#ffff80">We're leaving now.</font>

784
01:08:36,168 --> 01:08:37,751
<font color="#ffff80">Am I under arrest?</font>

785
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:40,793
<font color="#ffff80">I can hold you until your
wife's body turns up.</font>

786
01:08:40,959 --> 01:08:42,293
<font color="#ffff80">I demand an explanation.</font>

787
01:08:43,459 --> 01:08:46,334
<font color="#ffff80">I think you killed your
wife with the TH-16</font>

788
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:49,543
<font color="#ffff80">and stole her body so
there'd be no autopsy.</font>

789
01:08:51,543 --> 01:08:54,251
<font color="#ffff80">On what do you base
this fabrication?</font>

790
01:08:54,418 --> 01:08:57,084
<font color="#ffff80">Your behaviour, the vial
hidden in your pocket...</font>

791
01:08:57,251 --> 01:09:00,084
<font color="#ffff80">- It's not mine.
- They make it in your lab.</font>

792
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:02,959
<font color="#ffff80">It can cause cardiac arrest.</font>

793
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:04,209
<font color="#ffff80">You're a chemist,</font>

794
01:09:04,376 --> 01:09:07,209
<font color="#ffff80">your wife died of cardiac arrest.
Do you think I'm an idiot?</font>

795
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:09,043
<font color="#ffff80">Do you think I'm an idiot?</font>

796
01:09:09,584 --> 01:09:11,418
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't poison my wife.</font>

797
01:09:11,584 --> 01:09:15,043
<font color="#ffff80">If I did, I wouldn't come here
with a vial of the toxin.</font>

798
01:09:15,209 --> 01:09:17,918
<font color="#ffff80">It's absurd to poison
someone with TH-16,</font>

799
01:09:18,084 --> 01:09:19,834
<font color="#ffff80">then steal the body.</font>

800
01:09:20,001 --> 01:09:22,293
<font color="#ffff80">It's undetectable in
a routine autopsy.</font>

801
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:25,501
<font color="#ffff80">It wasn't your specialty
before, now you're an expert.</font>

802
01:09:25,668 --> 01:09:27,293
<font color="#ffff80">I was nervous before.</font>

803
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:31,001
<font color="#ffff80">If you want a confession to
close the case, forget it.</font>

804
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:33,251
<font color="#ffff80">You've got nothing on me.</font>

805
01:09:33,668 --> 01:09:36,959
<font color="#ffff80">I just need to show that something
went wrong so you took the body!</font>

806
01:09:37,126 --> 01:09:40,793
<font color="#ffff80">You need to find Mayka, and
I can't help you with that.</font>

807
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:42,668
<font color="#ffff80">I've no idea where she is.</font>

808
01:09:49,668 --> 01:09:51,251
<font color="#ffff80">How did you meet your wife?</font>

809
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:55,501
<font color="#ffff80">- What does that matter?
- Curiosity. Too many differences.</font>

810
01:09:55,793 --> 01:09:57,793
<font color="#ffff80">- Differences?
- In age,...</font>

811
01:09:58,043 --> 01:10:00,584
<font color="#ffff80">...status, everything.</font>

812
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:04,959
<font color="#ffff80">Answer me.</font>

813
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:09,418
<font color="#ffff80">It was in Avalon,</font>

814
01:10:09,584 --> 01:10:11,876
<font color="#ffff80">on Santa Catalina
Island, near L.A.</font>

815
01:10:12,293 --> 01:10:15,251
<font color="#ffff80">I spent some days there after my
first year in the university.</font>

816
01:10:15,418 --> 01:10:16,834
<font color="#ffff80">You taught Chemistry.</font>

817
01:10:17,001 --> 01:10:20,293
<font color="#ffff80">Yes. I didn't like it. I took
a trip to think it over.</font>

818
01:10:20,709 --> 01:10:24,959
<font color="#ffff80">One morning, going up a
mountain, a tyre blew out.</font>

819
01:10:25,209 --> 01:10:27,834
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka was the only person
I saw in three hours.</font>

820
01:10:28,001 --> 01:10:30,126
<font color="#ffff80">She gave me water, her mobile...</font>

821
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:32,126
<font color="#ffff80">and I changed the tyre.</font>

822
01:10:32,293 --> 01:10:35,543
<font color="#ffff80">- Lost on an island...
- We were at the same hotel.</font>

823
01:10:36,251 --> 01:10:38,876
<font color="#ffff80">She'd just lost her parents
and felt lost, like I did.</font>

824
01:10:39,043 --> 01:10:42,626
<font color="#ffff80">Lost but a millionaire. She'd
just inherited a fortune.</font>

825
01:10:43,793 --> 01:10:47,251
<font color="#ffff80">- We fell in love.
- How nice, like in the movies.</font>

826
01:10:47,418 --> 01:10:50,668
<font color="#ffff80">It's what happened. I was lucky.</font>

827
01:10:52,126 --> 01:10:53,876
<font color="#ffff80">Luck's something you have...</font>

828
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:56,043
<font color="#ffff80">or you seek it out.</font>

829
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:57,834
<font color="#ffff80">What do you think?</font>

830
01:10:59,876 --> 01:11:01,918
<font color="#ffff80">What the hell do
you want from me?</font>

831
01:11:11,209 --> 01:11:14,459
<font color="#ffff80">Let's go back to when you
found your wife's body.</font>

832
01:11:14,626 --> 01:11:17,209
<font color="#ffff80">I told the police who
came to my house.</font>

833
01:11:17,376 --> 01:11:19,168
<font color="#ffff80">I want you to tell me.</font>

834
01:11:23,334 --> 01:11:27,751
<font color="#ffff80">I came home and Mayka was
lying on the sofa, dead.</font>

835
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,751
<font color="#ffff80">I thought she was asleep,</font>

836
01:11:31,043 --> 01:11:33,834
<font color="#ffff80">but it was strange that
she had her shoes on.</font>

837
01:11:34,001 --> 01:11:37,626
<font color="#ffff80">I took her pulse, called an ambulance,
and they called the police.</font>

838
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,418
<font color="#ffff80">- And the last time you saw her alive?
- That morning.</font>

839
01:11:40,584 --> 01:11:44,001
<font color="#ffff80">Three weeks apart. She
arrives and you leave.</font>

840
01:11:44,168 --> 01:11:47,043
<font color="#ffff80">What are you insinuating?
I loved my wife.</font>

841
01:11:47,209 --> 01:11:50,793
<font color="#ffff80">- You loved her?
- I loved her to the last moment.</font>

842
01:11:52,293 --> 01:11:55,543
<font color="#ffff80">Don't you still love someone
after they're dead?</font>

843
01:12:01,126 --> 01:12:05,126
<font color="#ffff80">Your calm at her unexpected death
surprises me, it's unnerving.</font>

844
01:12:06,543 --> 01:12:10,084
<font color="#ffff80">I'm a scientist, I know
we're not machines.</font>

845
01:12:10,376 --> 01:12:12,959
<font color="#ffff80">I heard the forensic person:
a fear of flying can...</font>

846
01:12:13,126 --> 01:12:16,209
<font color="#ffff80">A handy theory for you, eh?
I'm sure you already knew.</font>

847
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:20,709
<font color="#ffff80">I had a heart scare two years
ago, with no previous signs.</font>

848
01:12:21,959 --> 01:12:24,376
<font color="#ffff80">These things come
without warning.</font>

849
01:12:24,543 --> 01:12:27,793
<font color="#ffff80">What did you do after your
wife's body was taken away?</font>

850
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:32,543
<font color="#ffff80">I made some calls, I cried...</font>

851
01:12:33,043 --> 01:12:36,001
<font color="#ffff80">Gloria, Luna and my sister came
over, we reminisced about Mayka.</font>

852
01:12:36,293 --> 01:12:37,626
<font color="#ffff80">And later?</font>

853
01:12:37,793 --> 01:12:41,293
<font color="#ffff80">Gloria, Luna and your
sister went home.</font>

854
01:12:41,626 --> 01:12:44,543
<font color="#ffff80">- What did you do then?
- Nothing.</font>

855
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:46,876
<font color="#ffff80">We sent a patrol car for you.
You weren't at home.</font>

856
01:12:47,501 --> 01:12:49,584
<font color="#ffff80">I went out for painkillers.
I told you.</font>

857
01:12:49,751 --> 01:12:52,043
<font color="#ffff80">- Painkillers...
- Yes. I had a headache.</font>

858
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:55,459
<font color="#ffff80">You came straight
here after our call.</font>

859
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:57,251
<font color="#ffff80">Exactly.</font>

860
01:12:57,418 --> 01:13:00,584
<font color="#ffff80">So you have the painkillers.
Show them to me.</font>

861
01:13:06,793 --> 01:13:07,876
<font color="#ffff80">This is absurd.</font>

862
01:13:08,043 --> 01:13:09,501
<font color="#ffff80">Convince me.</font>

863
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:16,626
<font color="#ffff80">Now you're ringing true.</font>

864
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:20,793
<font color="#ffff80">And as a reward, I'll give
you proof of my theory.</font>

865
01:13:23,918 --> 01:13:25,793
<font color="#ffff80">Proof you say I don't have.</font>

866
01:13:31,459 --> 01:13:34,709
<font color="#ffff80">Your wife hired a detective
three months ago.</font>

867
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:37,501
<font color="#ffff80">He's been following
you, Mr. Ulloa.</font>

868
01:13:38,334 --> 01:13:40,084
<font color="#ffff80">We have the invoice.</font>

869
01:13:40,668 --> 01:13:44,168
<font color="#ffff80">And also your marriage contract.</font>

870
01:13:47,376 --> 01:13:50,459
<font color="#ffff80">I think your wife suspected
you of cheating on her.</font>

871
01:13:51,043 --> 01:13:52,043
<font color="#ffff80">If so,</font>

872
01:13:52,209 --> 01:13:56,459
<font color="#ffff80">you would've violated one
of the main clauses,</font>

873
01:13:56,959 --> 01:14:01,459
<font color="#ffff80">and you'd lose all rights
if your wife divorced you.</font>

874
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:05,126
<font color="#ffff80">The question is: Did the
detective catch you?</font>

875
01:14:07,668 --> 01:14:10,293
<font color="#ffff80">I think you know the
answer to that,</font>

876
01:14:10,959 --> 01:14:14,126
<font color="#ffff80">and you killed her before she
cut you off with nothing.</font>

877
01:14:14,418 --> 01:14:16,251
<font color="#ffff80">We'll soon know for sure.</font>

878
01:14:16,501 --> 01:14:19,793
<font color="#ffff80">A patrol car is heading for
the home of Javier Alonso.</font>

879
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,001
<font color="#ffff80">Javier Alonso?</font>

880
01:14:25,376 --> 01:14:27,251
<font color="#ffff80">Your wife's detective.</font>

881
01:14:32,918 --> 01:14:35,501
<font color="#ffff80">Anything true you'd like to add?</font>

882
01:14:44,709 --> 01:14:46,043
<font color="#ffff80">Look at the name.</font>

883
01:14:52,459 --> 01:14:53,751
<font color="#ffff80">Diego Aguilar.</font>

884
01:15:00,918 --> 01:15:02,168
<font color="#ffff80">What are you doing?</font>

885
01:15:32,918 --> 01:15:34,001
<font color="#ffff80">Go ahead, Pablo.</font>

886
01:15:34,168 --> 01:15:37,043
<font color="#ffff80">We're in Alonso's office and
there's no trace of him</font>

887
01:15:37,209 --> 01:15:40,168
<font color="#ffff80">or any of the cases
he was investigating.</font>

888
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:42,668
<font color="#ffff80">Someone's taken his hard disk.</font>

889
01:15:42,918 --> 01:15:44,959
<font color="#ffff80">Register of last calls?
Messages?</font>

890
01:15:45,126 --> 01:15:46,584
<font color="#ffff80">There's nothing here, Jaime.</font>

891
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:47,918
<font color="#ffff80">Go to Ulloa's house.</font>

892
01:15:48,251 --> 01:15:52,001
<font color="#ffff80">- I'll call the judge for a warrant.
- Okay.</font>

893
01:15:52,459 --> 01:15:54,168
<font color="#ffff80">Where's the transfer car?</font>

894
01:15:57,043 --> 01:15:58,626
<font color="#ffff80">Norma here. Do you read me?</font>

895
01:15:59,251 --> 01:16:00,418
<font color="#ffff80">I read you. Go ahead.</font>

896
01:16:00,584 --> 01:16:03,168
<font color="#ffff80">Central said you were coming.
What's the delay?</font>

897
01:16:03,334 --> 01:16:06,043
<font color="#ffff80">The road's cut off.</font>

898
01:16:06,209 --> 01:16:09,084
<font color="#ffff80">The storm tore down
some power lines.</font>

899
01:16:09,293 --> 01:16:12,293
<font color="#ffff80">They don't know how long
it'll take to shift them.</font>

900
01:16:27,543 --> 01:16:28,876
<font color="#ffff80">Any news?</font>

901
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:33,126
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, babe. I'm knackered.
Want me to get you a coffee?</font>

902
01:17:13,293 --> 01:17:15,626
<font color="#ffff80">- Alex, is that you?
- Javier Alonso is a detective</font>

903
01:17:16,293 --> 01:17:17,501
<font color="#ffff80">I know.</font>

904
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:20,293
<font color="#ffff80">- You found him?
- Not exactly.</font>

905
01:17:20,459 --> 01:17:24,126
<font color="#ffff80">Someone put an envelope under my
door while I was at the hospital.</font>

906
01:17:27,126 --> 01:17:29,168
<font color="#ffff80">There was a pendrive in it.</font>

907
01:17:29,334 --> 01:17:32,126
<font color="#ffff80">- Is it from Javier Alonso?
- No sender.</font>

908
01:17:32,293 --> 01:17:36,376
<font color="#ffff80">It has a file in his name.
I'm sending you the photos.</font>

909
01:17:46,168 --> 01:17:47,334
<font color="#ffff80">Alex?</font>

910
01:17:50,251 --> 01:17:50,876
<font color="#ffff80">Alex!</font>

911
01:17:51,543 --> 01:17:52,626
<font color="#ffff80">Yes...</font>

912
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:56,709
<font color="#ffff80">That's not all. They put
a mike on you. Listen.</font>

913
01:17:56,876 --> 01:17:58,709
<font color="#ffff80">I've got everything.</font>

914
01:17:58,876 --> 01:18:01,501
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka's going to L.A. soon.
It'll be when she comes back.</font>

915
01:18:01,668 --> 01:18:04,543
<font color="#ffff80">She hates flying. It'll
explain the heart attack.</font>

916
01:18:06,918 --> 01:18:08,668
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka knew everything.</font>

917
01:18:09,501 --> 01:18:11,501
<font color="#ffff80">She sent it. She'll
be coming for you.</font>

918
01:18:12,168 --> 01:18:14,251
<font color="#ffff80">- You have to leave! Now!
- I am.</font>

919
01:18:14,418 --> 01:18:15,584
<font color="#ffff80">We'll be together soon.</font>

920
01:18:15,751 --> 01:18:18,001
<font color="#ffff80">You've been saying that all
night and you're still there.</font>

921
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:20,751
<font color="#ffff80">The main thing now
is to get you safe.</font>

922
01:18:20,918 --> 01:18:23,459
<font color="#ffff80">- And you?
- I'm fine.</font>

923
01:18:23,959 --> 01:18:26,459
<font color="#ffff80">How can you be fine? Alex,
they won't let you go!</font>

924
01:18:27,001 --> 01:18:28,834
<font color="#ffff80">Of course they will.</font>

925
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:32,168
<font color="#ffff80">- They'll make you confess!
- Listen to me, listen.</font>

926
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:36,043
<font color="#ffff80">If Mayka's still alive, they
can't accuse us of anything.</font>

927
01:18:36,209 --> 01:18:38,543
<font color="#ffff80">She knows it and wants us
to pay in her own way.</font>

928
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:40,209
<font color="#ffff80">She can do what she wants.</font>

929
01:18:40,376 --> 01:18:42,709
<font color="#ffff80">She's certified as dead,
she's free of any blame.</font>

930
01:18:42,876 --> 01:18:45,251
<font color="#ffff80">But I promise, nothing bad
will happen to you, okay?</font>

931
01:18:45,418 --> 01:18:47,126
<font color="#ffff80">I can't take this any more.</font>

932
01:18:47,959 --> 01:18:50,334
<font color="#ffff80">You and I should never have met.</font>

933
01:18:51,501 --> 01:18:52,834
<font color="#ffff80">Carla, I love you.</font>

934
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:55,918
<font color="#ffff80">- And I love you, but...
- Then trust me, please.</font>

935
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,209
<font color="#ffff80">What was that?</font>

936
01:19:01,001 --> 01:19:02,959
<font color="#ffff80">The lift is stuck.</font>

937
01:19:03,293 --> 01:19:04,626
<font color="#ffff80">Are you trapped?</font>

938
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,918
<font color="#ffff80">Fuck. It's stuck!</font>

939
01:19:07,084 --> 01:19:08,543
<font color="#ffff80">Push the alarm.</font>

940
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:10,709
<font color="#ffff80">What's happening now?</font>

941
01:19:11,584 --> 01:19:13,126
<font color="#ffff80">It's moving.</font>

942
01:19:14,001 --> 01:19:15,459
<font color="#ffff80">But are you alright?</font>

943
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:17,793
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know.</font>

944
01:19:18,709 --> 01:19:23,043
<font color="#ffff80">I get the feeling someone's
here, that I'm not alone.</font>

945
01:19:27,834 --> 01:19:28,959
<font color="#ffff80">Carla, are you alright?</font>

946
01:19:30,126 --> 01:19:32,626
<font color="#ffff80">Do anything to get out
of there and join me.</font>

947
01:19:32,793 --> 01:19:34,126
<font color="#ffff80">I promise.</font>

948
01:19:34,293 --> 01:19:36,543
<font color="#ffff80">We'll soon be together.
It'll all be fine.</font>

949
01:19:36,709 --> 01:19:39,626
<font color="#ffff80">Don't abandon me.
- Don '1' worry. Where will I find you?</font>

950
01:19:39,793 --> 01:19:43,418
<font color="#ffff80">- In the car.
- Good, go for a drive.</font>

951
01:19:43,584 --> 01:19:45,793
<font color="#ffff80">Don't stop, that'll be safest.</font>

952
01:19:47,709 --> 01:19:48,793
<font color="#ffff80">Carla?</font>

953
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:53,626
<font color="#ffff80">Carla?</font>

954
01:19:55,418 --> 01:19:56,834
<font color="#ffff80">Carla!</font>

955
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:07,418
<font color="#ffff80">What's he doing?</font>

956
01:20:19,418 --> 01:20:21,251
<font color="#ffff80">- Where the hell are you going?
- I've got to go.</font>

957
01:20:21,418 --> 01:20:23,543
<font color="#ffff80">I give the orders here and
you're in my custody.</font>

958
01:20:23,709 --> 01:20:25,209
<font color="#ffff80">Someone needs my help.</font>

959
01:20:25,376 --> 01:20:26,668
<font color="#ffff80">- Your help?
- Yes.</font>

960
01:20:26,834 --> 01:20:28,043
<font color="#ffff80">Who?</font>

961
01:20:28,543 --> 01:20:32,084
<font color="#ffff80">Who the hell do you think you are?
You think you can hold me?</font>

962
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:35,168
<font color="#ffff80">You've got no fucking idea
of what I'm capable of!</font>

963
01:20:36,084 --> 01:20:37,751
<font color="#ffff80">Piss off!</font>

964
01:20:46,668 --> 01:20:47,918
<font color="#ffff80">Alright.</font>

965
01:20:49,251 --> 01:20:51,084
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, that's the address.</font>

966
01:20:55,293 --> 01:20:56,959
<font color="#ffff80">Call me if there's any news.</font>

967
01:20:59,668 --> 01:21:03,543
<font color="#ffff80">A patrol car is heading for
the address you gave us.</font>

968
01:21:03,709 --> 01:21:06,959
<font color="#ffff80">Now tell me everything again,</font>

969
01:21:07,834 --> 01:21:09,334
<font color="#ffff80">from the beginning.</font>

970
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:24,001
<font color="#ffff80">Her name's Carla, Carla Miller.</font>

971
01:21:24,584 --> 01:21:25,834
<font color="#ffff80">I met her 8 months ago.</font>

972
01:21:26,001 --> 01:21:27,959
<font color="#ffff80">Class B, transposition...</font>

973
01:21:28,126 --> 01:21:30,501
<font color="#ffff80">I was giving a talk
at the university.</font>

974
01:21:30,668 --> 01:21:33,584
<font color="#ffff80">I'd been arguing with Mayka
and I couldn't concentrate.</font>

975
01:21:33,751 --> 01:21:37,293
<font color="#ffff80">I kept losing the thread. I
was about to stop the class</font>

976
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:40,834
<font color="#ffff80">when she arrived,
twenty minutes late</font>

977
01:21:41,793 --> 01:21:43,126
<font color="#ffff80">Excuse me.</font>

978
01:21:44,251 --> 01:21:45,501
<font color="#ffff80">Come in, come in.</font>

979
01:21:51,668 --> 01:21:53,168
<font color="#ffff80">In this process,</font>

980
01:21:54,418 --> 01:21:56,293
<font color="#ffff80">the proteins</font>

981
01:21:56,459 --> 01:21:59,251
<font color="#ffff80">can behave as co-factors...</font>

982
01:22:00,459 --> 01:22:02,543
<font color="#ffff80">...in an approximate
percentage...</font>

983
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:05,084
<font color="#ffff80">She came up and asked me
if she'd missed anything.</font>

984
01:22:05,251 --> 01:22:07,251
<font color="#ffff80">I said yes. I lied to her.</font>

985
01:22:08,501 --> 01:22:10,959
<font color="#ffff80">She snared me straightaway.</font>

986
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:17,084
<font color="#ffff80">She'd started Medicine. She was
struggling with Chemistry.</font>

987
01:22:17,251 --> 01:22:19,126
<font color="#ffff80">I offered to help her.</font>

988
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:22,543
<font color="#ffff80">It was all very easy. It
seemed natural to me.</font>

989
01:22:22,709 --> 01:22:26,376
<font color="#ffff80">At first we worked, but the
classes became an excuse</font>

990
01:22:26,543 --> 01:22:29,126
<font color="#ffff80">and we began seeing
each other every day.</font>

991
01:22:30,584 --> 01:22:34,084
<font color="#ffff80">I wanted to be honest, and
told her I was married</font>

992
01:22:34,251 --> 01:22:37,168
<font color="#ffff80">She had a boyfriend,
so it was all fine.</font>

993
01:22:39,543 --> 01:22:40,709
<font color="#ffff80">What are you doing here?</font>

994
01:22:40,876 --> 01:22:44,293
<font color="#ffff80">It was a harmless game. We
didn't do anything, just talked.</font>

995
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:47,543
<font color="#ffff80">But we spent so
much time together</font>

996
01:22:48,334 --> 01:22:49,626
<font color="#ffff80">that Mayka began to suspect.</font>

997
01:22:49,793 --> 01:22:51,501
<font color="#ffff80">I expected you earlier.</font>

998
01:22:52,126 --> 01:22:53,793
<font color="#ffff80">I tried to stop seeing her.</font>

999
01:22:53,959 --> 01:22:57,209
<font color="#ffff80">But it was impossible, all
I could think of was her.</font>

1000
01:22:57,459 --> 01:23:00,959
<font color="#ffff80">In the end, the
inevitable happened.</font>

1001
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:53,543
<font color="#ffff80">With Carla I felt alive again.</font>

1002
01:23:54,626 --> 01:23:58,043
<font color="#ffff80">That night, I told
her my life story,</font>

1003
01:23:58,668 --> 01:24:00,751
<font color="#ffff80">things I'd never told anyone.</font>

1004
01:24:00,918 --> 01:24:02,918
<font color="#ffff80">Neither of us wanted secrets.</font>

1005
01:24:04,376 --> 01:24:05,793
<font color="#ffff80">But there was my wife...</font>

1006
01:24:07,043 --> 01:24:09,084
<font color="#ffff80">She said she didn't
want to deceive anyone.</font>

1007
01:24:09,251 --> 01:24:12,834
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't want to deceive my wife,
but I was in love with Carla.</font>

1008
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:15,001
<font color="#ffff80">She left her boyfriend for me.</font>

1009
01:24:16,001 --> 01:24:19,543
<font color="#ffff80">But I wasn't ready to
tell Mayka the truth.</font>

1010
01:24:19,751 --> 01:24:21,501
<font color="#ffff80">And Carla got tired of waiting.</font>

1011
01:24:21,668 --> 01:24:23,418
<font color="#ffff80">She refused to see me any more.</font>

1012
01:24:23,793 --> 01:24:25,584
<font color="#ffff80">And she vanished from the map.</font>

1013
01:24:26,043 --> 01:24:27,459
<font color="#ffff80">I went crazy.</font>

1014
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:30,043
<font color="#ffff80">I couldn't live without her.
I had to do something.</font>

1015
01:24:30,668 --> 01:24:33,084
<font color="#ffff80">There was no going back.
I was in love.</font>

1016
01:24:33,251 --> 01:24:35,251
<font color="#ffff80">And I decided. I
went to see her.</font>

1017
01:24:36,376 --> 01:24:40,459
<font color="#ffff80">I told her it was over with Mayka,
I'd leave her to be with her.</font>

1018
01:24:41,751 --> 01:24:43,751
<font color="#ffff80">I love you.</font>

1019
01:24:45,834 --> 01:24:47,501
<font color="#ffff80">But it wasn't that easy.</font>

1020
01:24:48,043 --> 01:24:50,418
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka was stalking
me, watching me.</font>

1021
01:24:50,584 --> 01:24:53,918
<font color="#ffff80">I knew a divorce would
mean war, and she'd win.</font>

1022
01:24:54,751 --> 01:24:56,668
<font color="#ffff80">She'd destroy me. She'd
leave me with nothing.</font>

1023
01:24:56,834 --> 01:24:59,501
<font color="#ffff80">She'd make me start from nothing
to show she was still in control.</font>

1024
01:24:59,668 --> 01:25:02,126
<font color="#ffff80">You say you want to be with me,
but you don't want a divorce.</font>

1025
01:25:02,293 --> 01:25:04,918
<font color="#ffff80">I don't want to be with you
while you're with her.</font>

1026
01:25:05,084 --> 01:25:06,584
<font color="#ffff80">I can't take any more.</font>

1027
01:25:07,043 --> 01:25:10,459
<font color="#ffff80">This is over, I can't
take any more.</font>

1028
01:25:23,334 --> 01:25:26,584
<font color="#ffff80">I can stop being with her
without getting a divorce.</font>

1029
01:25:27,209 --> 01:25:28,918
<font color="#ffff80">We can have it all.</font>

1030
01:25:30,043 --> 01:25:32,334
<font color="#ffff80">She could have an accident.</font>

1031
01:25:33,418 --> 01:25:35,751
<font color="#ffff80">I need to know if
Carla's alright.</font>

1032
01:25:36,876 --> 01:25:38,668
<font color="#ffff80">There's something I don't get.</font>

1033
01:25:40,209 --> 01:25:43,543
<font color="#ffff80">If you carefully planned
your wife's death,</font>

1034
01:25:43,793 --> 01:25:46,668
<font color="#ffff80">sure of the toxin's
infallibility,</font>

1035
01:25:47,001 --> 01:25:48,543
<font color="#ffff80">why would she be alive?</font>

1036
01:25:50,418 --> 01:25:51,251
<font color="#ffff80">I saw you.</font>

1037
01:25:51,418 --> 01:25:53,543
<font color="#ffff80">Your wife hired a detective
three months ago.</font>

1038
01:25:53,709 --> 01:25:55,293
<font color="#ffff80">There are a lot of things
you don't know about me.</font>

1039
01:25:55,459 --> 01:25:56,959
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka's going to L.A. soon.</font>

1040
01:25:57,126 --> 01:25:59,459
<font color="#ffff80">Her fear of flying can
explain a heart attack.</font>

1041
01:25:59,626 --> 01:26:02,709
<font color="#ffff80">Someone put an envelope under my
door while I was at the hospital.</font>

1042
01:26:02,876 --> 01:26:04,043
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka knew everything.</font>

1043
01:26:04,334 --> 01:26:08,084
<font color="#ffff80">How did she avoid dying? You
saw her drink the wine.</font>

1044
01:26:11,668 --> 01:26:13,376
<font color="#ffff80">She could've switched glasses.</font>

1045
01:26:19,251 --> 01:26:22,918
<font color="#ffff80">If she did, what do you
think happened next?</font>

1046
01:26:23,084 --> 01:26:27,334
<font color="#ffff80">She could've taken a neuroleptic
to enter a state of catalepsy.</font>

1047
01:26:28,043 --> 01:26:31,001
<font color="#ffff80">Some can be diluted
in the blood,</font>

1048
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,709
<font color="#ffff80">slow down the lungs and
virtually stop the heart.</font>

1049
01:26:35,126 --> 01:26:38,084
<font color="#ffff80">Once the agent metabolizes
in the organism,</font>

1050
01:26:38,584 --> 01:26:40,334
<font color="#ffff80">the body returns to normal.</font>

1051
01:26:40,501 --> 01:26:42,959
<font color="#ffff80">A little twisted. And dangerous.</font>

1052
01:26:43,126 --> 01:26:44,876
<font color="#ffff80">Not for Mayka.</font>

1053
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:48,751
<font color="#ffff80">She likes to play.</font>

1054
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:51,793
<font color="#ffff80">And she hates to lose.</font>

1055
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:56,001
<font color="#ffff80">Listen, I've told
you everything.</font>

1056
01:26:56,584 --> 01:26:59,501
<font color="#ffff80">Please, ask after Carla.</font>

1057
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:03,918
<font color="#ffff80">Jaime.</font>

1058
01:27:07,168 --> 01:27:08,626
<font color="#ffff80">I'll be right back.</font>

1059
01:27:09,043 --> 01:27:11,751
<font color="#ffff80">- Who is it?
- Pablo, from Ulloa's house.</font>

1060
01:27:14,584 --> 01:27:15,376
<font color="#ffff80">Go ahead.</font>

1061
01:27:15,543 --> 01:27:18,376
<font color="#ffff80">We found plans of the morgue.
There's a route mapped out</font>

1062
01:27:18,543 --> 01:27:22,126
<font color="#ffff80">and instructions on how to
manipulate the security system.</font>

1063
01:27:22,459 --> 01:27:24,293
<font color="#ffff80">We're taking all the papers.</font>

1064
01:27:24,459 --> 01:27:27,001
<font color="#ffff80">- He knew the building backwards.
- Any trace of the body?</font>

1065
01:27:27,168 --> 01:27:28,084
<font color="#ffff80">No, but we found</font>

1066
01:27:28,251 --> 01:27:30,834
<font color="#ffff80">a shovel and a sports bag
in the boot of Ulla's car.</font>

1067
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:33,168
<font color="#ffff80">In it were a balaclava
and some trainers</font>

1068
01:27:33,334 --> 01:27:37,168
<font color="#ffff80">that match the footprints on the
morgue 's emergency stairs.</font>

1069
01:27:37,584 --> 01:27:38,418
<font color="#ffff80">Anything else?</font>

1070
01:27:38,584 --> 01:27:42,293
<font color="#ffff80">We also found a '32
hidden in a box.</font>

1071
01:27:42,459 --> 01:27:46,168
<font color="#ffff80">It's unregistered and has
been fired recently.</font>

1072
01:27:46,793 --> 01:27:48,418
<font color="#ffff80">What the hell's going on?</font>

1073
01:27:49,709 --> 01:27:50,959
<font color="#ffff80">I've got another call.</font>

1074
01:27:53,418 --> 01:27:54,251
<font color="#ffff80">What is it?</font>

1075
01:27:54,501 --> 01:27:56,376
<font color="#ffff80">Angel Torres is awake.</font>

1076
01:27:56,626 --> 01:27:58,459
<font color="#ffff80">- Hold on.
- Okay.</font>

1077
01:28:01,668 --> 01:28:03,418
<font color="#ffff80">The guard is conscious.</font>

1078
01:28:04,084 --> 01:28:07,334
<font color="#ffff80">I'll pass you to the hospital.
We're heading for the woods.</font>

1079
01:28:08,168 --> 01:28:09,459
<font color="#ffff80">- Jaime.
- How is he?</font>

1080
01:28:09,626 --> 01:28:12,043
<font color="#ffff80">Disoriented, but I spoke to him.</font>

1081
01:28:12,209 --> 01:28:14,834
<font color="#ffff80">- What did he say?
- You're not gonna believe it.</font>

1082
01:28:15,001 --> 01:28:16,084
<font color="#ffff80">Fire away.</font>

1083
01:29:55,668 --> 01:29:57,084
<font color="#ffff80">Hello?</font>

1084
01:30:13,168 --> 01:30:16,876
<font color="#ffff80">Yes. This is Angel Torres.
I'm calling from the morgue.</font>

1085
01:30:17,043 --> 01:30:19,918
<font color="#ffff80">I think... I need
you to come here.</font>

1086
01:30:20,293 --> 01:30:23,459
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, I'll wait. Hurry up.</font>

1087
01:30:46,168 --> 01:30:48,959
<font color="#ffff80">He ran out of the morgue
like a scared rat</font>

1088
01:30:49,126 --> 01:30:50,751
<font color="#ffff80">until he was run over.</font>

1089
01:30:51,793 --> 01:30:54,543
<font color="#ffff80">We just found them.
They're from a '32,</font>

1090
01:30:55,293 --> 01:30:56,626
<font color="#ffff80">like the gun at your house.</font>

1091
01:30:56,959 --> 01:30:59,293
<font color="#ffff80">I don't own a gun. It was Mayka.</font>

1092
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:01,584
<font color="#ffff80">Your wife's dead, Mr. Ulloa.
Dead.</font>

1093
01:31:01,751 --> 01:31:05,084
<font color="#ffff80">You can't prove it. They haven't
found the body, nor will they.</font>

1094
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,626
<font color="#ffff80">- Because you took it!
- I didn't do anything.</font>

1095
01:31:07,793 --> 01:31:10,418
<font color="#ffff80">You motherfucker! You killed
her, then took her away.</font>

1096
01:31:10,584 --> 01:31:12,793
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka wants you to think that.
Can't you see?</font>

1097
01:31:13,876 --> 01:31:16,584
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka's behind it all. She set
it up with someone's help.</font>

1098
01:31:16,751 --> 01:31:19,626
<font color="#ffff80">She faked her disappearance
and made sure she'd wake up.</font>

1099
01:31:27,418 --> 01:31:29,501
<font color="#ffff80">She's fucking alive!
She's alive!</font>

1100
01:31:29,668 --> 01:31:31,668
<font color="#ffff80">No! You took her body!</font>

1101
01:31:31,834 --> 01:31:34,251
<font color="#ffff80">The plans to the morgue
were hidden in your house.</font>

1102
01:31:34,418 --> 01:31:35,668
<font color="#ffff80">You had it all worked out.</font>

1103
01:31:35,834 --> 01:31:38,251
<font color="#ffff80">You distracted the
guard to confuse us.</font>

1104
01:31:38,418 --> 01:31:42,376
<font color="#ffff80">You knew he'd confuse us,
but then he got run over,</font>

1105
01:31:42,543 --> 01:31:45,709
<font color="#ffff80">so you've been winging it
all night, playing with us!</font>

1106
01:31:45,876 --> 01:31:47,751
<font color="#ffff80">What does it matter now?</font>

1107
01:31:49,668 --> 01:31:52,751
<font color="#ffff80">It was set up so that Mayka
would be declared dead,</font>

1108
01:31:52,918 --> 01:31:54,043
<font color="#ffff80">and I'd confess.</font>

1109
01:31:58,709 --> 01:32:02,543
<font color="#ffff80">Nothing that happened
tonight was an accident,</font>

1110
01:32:02,709 --> 01:32:04,126
<font color="#ffff80">believe me.</font>

1111
01:32:04,543 --> 01:32:08,793
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka has the power and money
to vanish without a trace.</font>

1112
01:32:09,668 --> 01:32:13,418
<font color="#ffff80">It's perfect. She
left no loose ends.</font>

1113
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:19,876
<font color="#ffff80">If it's not too late, Carla
will corroborate my story.</font>

1114
01:32:20,043 --> 01:32:23,334
<font color="#ffff80">How do you keep justifying
the unjustifiable?</font>

1115
01:32:23,584 --> 01:32:26,418
<font color="#ffff80">Don't you get tired?
Aren't you disgusted?</font>

1116
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:29,334
<font color="#ffff80">Please...</font>

1117
01:32:30,793 --> 01:32:32,709
<font color="#ffff80">I need you to help Carla.</font>

1118
01:32:34,084 --> 01:32:35,376
<font color="#ffff80">Please.</font>

1119
01:33:21,626 --> 01:33:23,209
<font color="#ffff80">Any news on Carla Miller?</font>

1120
01:33:23,376 --> 01:33:24,376
<font color="#ffff80">There's no one here.</font>

1121
01:33:24,543 --> 01:33:26,001
<font color="#ffff80">- An y signs of violence?
- No.</font>

1122
01:33:26,168 --> 01:33:28,626
<font color="#ffff80">The suspect claims
the girl was warned.</font>

1123
01:33:28,793 --> 01:33:30,543
<font color="#ffff80">Could she have run away?</font>

1124
01:33:30,709 --> 01:33:34,668
<font color="#ffff80">If she hasn't, someone's
made it look that way.</font>

1125
01:33:36,668 --> 01:33:38,709
<font color="#ffff80">I'll call you if
there's any news.</font>

1126
01:33:44,584 --> 01:33:46,418
<font color="#ffff80">Tow truck to the coordinates.
Copy that.</font>

1127
01:33:46,584 --> 01:33:48,543
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know what
we'll find there.</font>

1128
01:33:48,709 --> 01:33:50,751
<font color="#ffff80">I'll await instructions
and tell HQ.</font>

1129
01:33:50,918 --> 01:33:53,626
<font color="#ffff80">The tow truck will be 15 minutes.
Everything else in order?</font>

1130
01:33:53,793 --> 01:33:56,959
<font color="#ffff80">- Yes, but I need the traffic diverted.
- I'll tell them.</font>

1131
01:33:59,584 --> 01:34:02,626
<font color="#ffff80">Jaime's here now. When I speak
to him, I'll relay the info.</font>

1132
01:34:04,376 --> 01:34:06,293
<font color="#ffff80">We've found a body.</font>

1133
01:34:07,209 --> 01:34:08,626
<font color="#ffff80">Tell Norma and Mateos.</font>

1134
01:35:38,834 --> 01:35:42,584
<font color="#ffff80">No one lives at the address
you gave us for Carla Miller.</font>

1135
01:35:43,543 --> 01:35:45,876
<font color="#ffff80">The flat's been
vacant for years.</font>

1136
01:35:47,209 --> 01:35:50,293
<font color="#ffff80">And the neighbours can't
recall any Carla Miller.</font>

1137
01:35:51,001 --> 01:35:54,334
<font color="#ffff80">We also checked
Sacred Heart Hospital</font>

1138
01:35:54,959 --> 01:35:56,793
<font color="#ffff80">and the Faculty of Medicine,</font>

1139
01:35:57,418 --> 01:35:59,709
<font color="#ffff80">but the person you describe...</font>

1140
01:36:01,043 --> 01:36:02,876
<font color="#ffff80">does not exist.</font>

1141
01:36:07,626 --> 01:36:09,209
<font color="#ffff80">Do you know what I think?</font>

1142
01:36:10,959 --> 01:36:12,626
<font color="#ffff80">You invented her</font>

1143
01:36:12,793 --> 01:36:14,876
<font color="#ffff80">because you're
weak and a coward.</font>

1144
01:36:15,543 --> 01:36:16,834
<font color="#ffff80">You invented her.</font>

1145
01:36:17,459 --> 01:36:21,459
<font color="#ffff80">Carla Miller gave you the courage to
kill your wife and keep her money.</font>

1146
01:36:28,209 --> 01:36:30,626
<font color="#ffff80">Get Forensics to
take away the body.</font>

1147
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:34,751
<font color="#ffff80">And clear the road when you
can, this looks like a circus.</font>

1148
01:36:34,918 --> 01:36:36,751
<font color="#ffff80">Everyone, get out of here. Go!</font>

1149
01:36:36,918 --> 01:36:38,751
<font color="#ffff80">You heard. Everyone out.</font>

1150
01:36:39,251 --> 01:36:42,376
<font color="#ffff80">Call the judge. Tell
him we found the body</font>

1151
01:36:42,543 --> 01:36:45,626
<font color="#ffff80">and we can charge Ulloa
whenever he orders it.</font>

1152
01:36:54,418 --> 01:36:55,668
<font color="#ffff80">Get up.</font>

1153
01:36:57,626 --> 01:36:59,418
<font color="#ffff80">C'mon, get up. Let's go.</font>

1154
01:37:52,668 --> 01:37:54,084
<font color="#ffff80">Where are you going?</font>

1155
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:03,293
<font color="#ffff80">I know.</font>

1156
01:38:04,209 --> 01:38:08,168
<font color="#ffff80">It's hard pretending to be
what you're not all the time.</font>

1157
01:38:08,334 --> 01:38:09,584
<font color="#ffff80">What's wrong with me?</font>

1158
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:11,626
<font color="#ffff80">We've been at it eight
hours straight,</font>

1159
01:38:11,793 --> 01:38:14,251
<font color="#ffff80">shut in a goddamn morgue.</font>

1160
01:38:14,418 --> 01:38:16,209
<font color="#ffff80">How do you expect to feel?</font>

1161
01:38:16,376 --> 01:38:18,084
<font color="#ffff80">I need help. Please.</font>

1162
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:19,876
<font color="#ffff80">Please.</font>

1163
01:38:24,751 --> 01:38:25,959
<font color="#ffff80">You know what?</font>

1164
01:38:28,168 --> 01:38:30,251
<font color="#ffff80">This reminds me of my wife.</font>

1165
01:38:31,918 --> 01:38:35,209
<font color="#ffff80">She died 10 years ago today.</font>

1166
01:38:40,918 --> 01:38:44,209
<font color="#ffff80">The official version is
that she had an accident.</font>

1167
01:38:44,959 --> 01:38:46,293
<font color="#ffff80">She was murdered.</font>

1168
01:39:06,168 --> 01:39:08,418
<font color="#ffff80">My daughter was in the car too.</font>

1169
01:39:13,959 --> 01:39:14,751
<font color="#ffff80">Are you okay?</font>

1170
01:39:14,918 --> 01:39:16,168
<font color="#ffff80">Yes.</font>

1171
01:39:18,584 --> 01:39:19,584
<font color="#ffff80">Ruth?</font>

1172
01:39:27,459 --> 01:39:30,668
<font color="#ffff80">A call to Emergencies
would've saved her life.</font>

1173
01:39:30,834 --> 01:39:33,376
<font color="#ffff80">But the car that
hit us drove off.</font>

1174
01:39:33,543 --> 01:39:37,293
<font color="#ffff80">I guess they were high
on some shit, or drunk.</font>

1175
01:39:37,626 --> 01:39:40,168
<font color="#ffff80">They left us there like dogs.</font>

1176
01:39:49,293 --> 01:39:51,584
<font color="#ffff80">Help! Help!</font>

1177
01:40:08,126 --> 01:40:10,168
<font color="#ffff80">She hung on for an hour.</font>

1178
01:40:10,709 --> 01:40:12,459
<font color="#ffff80">Ruth, my love...</font>

1179
01:40:13,418 --> 01:40:16,626
<font color="#ffff80">But she died a few minutes
before we were found.</font>

1180
01:40:22,001 --> 01:40:24,501
<font color="#ffff80">I tried to recall
the license plate.</font>

1181
01:40:25,626 --> 01:40:26,793
<font color="#ffff80">Nothing.</font>

1182
01:40:27,959 --> 01:40:30,668
<font color="#ffff80">Until, years later, my
daughter remembered.</font>

1183
01:40:35,293 --> 01:40:36,376
<font color="#ffff80">A hotel...</font>

1184
01:40:37,293 --> 01:40:39,168
<font color="#ffff80">...in Avalon,...</font>

1185
01:40:39,543 --> 01:40:41,709
<font color="#ffff80">...on the Island
of Santa Catalina.</font>

1186
01:40:42,959 --> 01:40:45,876
<font color="#ffff80">It was like looking for
a needle in a haystack.</font>

1187
01:40:46,459 --> 01:40:49,668
<font color="#ffff80">But I had all the time in
the world, and I found it.</font>

1188
01:40:57,418 --> 01:40:58,626
<font color="#ffff80">Drive.</font>

1189
01:40:59,876 --> 01:41:00,918
<font color="#ffff80">There's a little girl.</font>

1190
01:41:01,084 --> 01:41:03,293
<font color="#ffff80">- Did she see you?
- No.</font>

1191
01:41:04,001 --> 01:41:05,626
<font color="#ffff80">Then drive.</font>

1192
01:41:06,126 --> 01:41:10,626
<font color="#ffff80">How could you live all these years
knowing you were murderers?</font>

1193
01:41:13,084 --> 01:41:14,751
<font color="#ffff80">I want you to see something.</font>

1194
01:41:15,584 --> 01:41:17,334
<font color="#ffff80">It'll help you understand.</font>

1195
01:41:19,501 --> 01:41:22,793
<font color="#ffff80">My daughter. Her name's Eva.</font>

1196
01:41:24,668 --> 01:41:27,001
<font color="#ffff80">I won '1' be with you as
long as you're with her.</font>

1197
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:30,543
<font color="#ffff80">We could have it all. She
could have an accident.</font>

1198
01:41:31,709 --> 01:41:33,501
<font color="#ffff80">Why won't you answer it?</font>

1199
01:41:33,668 --> 01:41:34,918
<font color="#ffff80">- Yes?
- Mr. Ulloa?</font>

1200
01:41:35,084 --> 01:41:38,293
<font color="#ffff80">This is Jaime Pefia. I'm
calling from the morgue.</font>

1201
01:41:39,001 --> 01:41:41,001
<font color="#ffff80">Your wife's body
has disappeared.</font>

1202
01:41:41,168 --> 01:41:42,751
<font color="#ffff80">What do you mean "disappeared"?</font>

1203
01:41:43,126 --> 01:41:45,501
<font color="#ffff80">It has to be more personal.</font>

1204
01:41:45,876 --> 01:41:50,376
<font color="#ffff80">Someone wishing to harm your
wife, even after she was dead.</font>

1205
01:41:50,793 --> 01:41:51,668
<font color="#ffff80">I'm in the car.</font>

1206
01:41:51,834 --> 01:41:55,043
<font color="#ffff80">I went out for a smoke. The
guard's still unconscious.</font>

1207
01:41:55,501 --> 01:41:59,084
<font color="#ffff80">We found a shovel and a sports
bag in the boot of Ulloa's car.</font>

1208
01:41:59,251 --> 01:42:02,126
<font color="#ffff80">In it are a balaclava
and some trainers</font>

1209
01:42:02,293 --> 01:42:05,543
<font color="#ffff80">that match the footprints on the
morgue 's emergency stairs.</font>

1210
01:42:07,918 --> 01:42:09,918
<font color="#ffff80">You were ready to
believe it all.</font>

1211
01:42:13,834 --> 01:42:15,168
<font color="#ffff80">Especially Carla.</font>

1212
01:42:16,501 --> 01:42:18,834
<font color="#ffff80">I just came out of
the restaurant.</font>

1213
01:42:19,126 --> 01:42:21,959
<font color="#ffff80">I left the mobile in the bathroom.
No one saw me.</font>

1214
01:42:22,126 --> 01:42:24,376
<font color="#ffff80">- What was that?
- The lift is stuck.</font>

1215
01:42:24,543 --> 01:42:26,376
<font color="#ffff80">We'll soon be together.</font>

1216
01:42:30,084 --> 01:42:31,084
<font color="#ffff80">Carla ?</font>

1217
01:42:32,751 --> 01:42:33,418
<font color="#ffff80">Carla!</font>

1218
01:42:36,126 --> 01:42:38,501
<font color="#ffff80">Eva got to you without
my knowledge.</font>

1219
01:42:38,668 --> 01:42:40,959
<font color="#ffff80">She feared the car she recalled</font>

1220
01:42:41,126 --> 01:42:43,251
<font color="#ffff80">didn't belong to her
mother's killers,</font>

1221
01:42:43,418 --> 01:42:45,876
<font color="#ffff80">that you and your
wife were innocent.</font>

1222
01:42:46,043 --> 01:42:48,084
<font color="#ffff80">I knew it was you.</font>

1223
01:42:48,251 --> 01:42:51,209
<font color="#ffff80">But she didn't, and she
wanted to be sure.</font>

1224
01:42:51,376 --> 01:42:55,293
<font color="#ffff80">The only way to verify your
guilt was to make you talk.</font>

1225
01:42:56,584 --> 01:42:58,084
<font color="#ffff80">She did it.</font>

1226
01:42:59,084 --> 01:43:02,418
<font color="#ffff80">You confessed your
darkest secret to her.</font>

1227
01:43:04,293 --> 01:43:06,793
<font color="#ffff80">Eva knew I was ready to act.</font>

1228
01:43:07,251 --> 01:43:10,918
<font color="#ffff80">She knew if she told me you'd
confessed to your crime,</font>

1229
01:43:11,751 --> 01:43:15,043
<font color="#ffff80">I'd have a green light to
go after you and your wife.</font>

1230
01:43:16,501 --> 01:43:17,793
<font color="#ffff80">And she did it.</font>

1231
01:43:17,959 --> 01:43:19,751
<font color="#ffff80">We have to do it, honey.</font>

1232
01:43:19,918 --> 01:43:21,709
<font color="#ffff80">She told me everything.</font>

1233
01:43:21,876 --> 01:43:25,126
<font color="#ffff80">Since then you've just been
a puppet in our hands.</font>

1234
01:43:26,459 --> 01:43:28,209
<font color="#ffff80">I know what you're thinking.</font>

1235
01:43:28,543 --> 01:43:31,043
<font color="#ffff80">Ten years leaves a lot
of time for thinking.</font>

1236
01:43:37,168 --> 01:43:38,876
<font color="#ffff80">The detective...</font>

1237
01:43:40,209 --> 01:43:42,043
<font color="#ffff80">...was a bargain.</font>

1238
01:43:42,209 --> 01:43:45,418
<font color="#ffff80">I just had to put the
invoice in the dossier.</font>

1239
01:43:45,584 --> 01:43:47,418
<font color="#ffff80">Eva and I took care of the rest.</font>

1240
01:43:47,876 --> 01:43:50,376
<font color="#ffff80">They also put a mike on you.
Listen.</font>

1241
01:43:50,543 --> 01:43:52,793
<font color="#ffff80">I've got everything. Mayka's
going to L.A. soon.</font>

1242
01:43:52,959 --> 01:43:55,668
<font color="#ffff80">It'll be when she comes back.
She hates flying.</font>

1243
01:43:55,834 --> 01:43:58,084
<font color="#ffff80">It'll explain the heart attack.</font>

1244
01:43:59,293 --> 01:44:01,043
<font color="#ffff80">Mayka knew everything.</font>

1245
01:44:01,626 --> 01:44:03,293
<font color="#ffff80">I'm at the airport.</font>

1246
01:44:03,459 --> 01:44:06,459
<font color="#ffff80">There's now no trace
of me you-know-where.</font>

1247
01:44:06,626 --> 01:44:08,334
<font color="#ffff80">Nobody saw me get here.</font>

1248
01:44:08,668 --> 01:44:10,251
<font color="#ffff80">I'm going back to Berlin.</font>

1249
01:44:10,959 --> 01:44:13,668
<font color="#ffff80">Javier Alonso is
conveniently on a trip.</font>

1250
01:44:13,834 --> 01:44:15,876
<font color="#ffff80">And of course, he didn't
find out anything.</font>

1251
01:44:16,043 --> 01:44:19,459
<font color="#ffff80">The only thing on record
is that Mayka hired him.</font>

1252
01:44:19,626 --> 01:44:22,709
<font color="#ffff80">I have your wife's body
and your confession.</font>

1253
01:44:23,418 --> 01:44:26,418
<font color="#ffff80">Nothing alters the
consequences of our actions.</font>

1254
01:44:27,126 --> 01:44:30,126
<font color="#ffff80">Sooner or later, someone
calls in the debt.</font>

1255
01:44:43,918 --> 01:44:46,209
<font color="#ffff80">You'll soon be joining her.</font>

1256
01:44:47,334 --> 01:44:49,126
<font color="#ffff80">- What's TH-16?
- A toxin.</font>

1257
01:44:49,293 --> 01:44:50,126
<font color="#ffff80">What kind?</font>

1258
01:44:50,293 --> 01:44:52,251
<font color="#ffff80">It's extracted from
certain reptiles.</font>

1259
01:44:52,418 --> 01:44:53,626
<font color="#ffff80">Why won't you answer it?</font>

1260
01:44:53,793 --> 01:44:54,668
<font color="#ffff80">Hello?</font>

1261
01:44:54,834 --> 01:44:56,918
<font color="#ffff80">Mr. Ulloa, this is
Inspector Jaime Pefia.</font>

1262
01:44:57,084 --> 01:44:59,001

- What do you mean "disappeared"?</font>

happened by accident.</font>

1265
01:45:06,209 --> 01:45:08,543
<font color="#ffff80">- Who was it?
- The police.</font>

1266
01:45:09,459 --> 01:45:11,543
<font color="#ffff80">I had a heart scare
two years ago,</font>

1267
01:45:11,709 --> 01:45:12,584
<font color="#ffff80">and I was fine.</font>

1268
01:45:12,751 --> 01:45:16,709
<font color="#ffff80">We've been at it 8 hours straight,
shut in a goddamn morgue.</font>

1269
01:45:16,876 --> 01:45:18,126
<font color="#ffff80">How do you expect to feel?</font>

1270
01:45:18,293 --> 01:45:19,543
<font color="#ffff80">Diluted in blood,</font>

1271

ingestion and leaves no trace.</font>

1272
